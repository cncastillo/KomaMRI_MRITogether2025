  abstract = {We introduce a model-based image reconstruction framework with a convolution neural network (CNN)-based regularization prior. The proposed formulation provides a systematic approach for deriving deep architectures for inverse problems with the arbitrary structure. Since the forward model is explicitly accounted for, a smaller network with fewer parameters is sufficient to capture the image information compared to direct inversion approaches. Thus, reducing the demand for training data and training time. Since we rely on end-to-end training with weight sharing across iterations, the CNN weights are customized to the forward model, thus offering improved performance over approaches that rely on pre-trained denoisers. Our experiments show that the decoupling of the number of iterations from the network complexity offered by this approach provides benefits, including lower demand for training data, reduced risk of overfitting, and implementations with significantly reduced memory footprint. We propose to enforce data-consistency by using numerical optimization blocks, such as conjugate gradients algorithm within the network. This approach offers faster convergence per iteration, compared to methods that rely on proximal gradients steps to enforce data consistency. Our experiments show that the faster convergence translates to improved performance, primarily when the available GPU memory restricts the number of iterations.},

  abstract = {Purpose To design and evaluate eddy current--nulled convex optimized diffusion encoding (EN-CODE) gradient waveforms for efficient diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that is free of eddy current--induced image distortions. Methods The EN-CODE framework was used to generate diffusion-encoding waveforms that are eddy current--compensated. The EN-CODE DTI waveform was compared with the existing eddy current--nulled twice refocused spin echo (TRSE) sequence as well as monopolar (MONO) and non--eddy current--compensated CODE in terms of echo time (TE) and image distortions. Comparisons were made in simulations, phantom experiments, and neuro imaging in 10 healthy volunteers. Results The EN-CODE sequence achieved eddy current compensation with a significantly shorter TE than TRSE (78 versus 96 ms) and a slightly shorter TE than MONO (78 versus 80 ms). Intravoxel signal variance was lower in phantoms with EN-CODE than with MONO (13.6 {\textpm} 11.6 versus 37.4 {\textpm} 25.8) and not different from TRSE (15.1 {\textpm} 11.6), indicating good robustness to eddy current--induced image distortions. Mean fractional anisotropy values in brain edges were also significantly lower with EN-CODE than with MONO (0.16 {\textpm} 0.01 versus 0.24 {\textpm} 0.02, P {$<$} 1 x 10-5) and not different from TRSE (0.16 {\textpm} 0.01 versus 0.16 {\textpm} 0.01, P = nonsignificant).

  abstract = {Modern MRI scanners have trended toward higher field strengths to maximize signal and resolution while minimizing scan time. However, high-field devices remain expensive to install and operate, making them scarce outside of high-income countries and major population centers. Low-field strength scanners have drawn renewed academic, industry, and philanthropic interest due to advantages that could dramatically increase imaging access, including lower cost and portability. Nevertheless, low-field MRI still faces inherent limitations in image quality that come with decreased signal. In this article, we review advantages and disadvantages of low-field MRI scanners, describe hardware and software innovations that accentuate advantages and mitigate disadvantages, and consider clinical applications for a new generation of low-field devices. In our review, we explore how these devices are being or could be used for high acuity brain imaging, outpatient neuroimaging, MRI-guided procedures, pediatric imaging, and musculoskeletal imaging. Challenges for their successful clinical translation include selecting and validating appropriate use cases, integrating with standards of care in high resource settings, expanding options with actionable information in low resource settings, and facilitating health care providers and clinical practice in new ways. By embracing both the promise and challenges of low-field MRI, clinicians and researchers have an opportunity to transform medical care for patients around the world.

  abstract = {The diameter of a myelinated nerve axon is directly proportional to its conduction velocity, so the axon diameter distribution helps determine the channel capacity of nervous transmission along fascicles in the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS). Previously, this histological information could only be obtained using invasive tissue biopsies. Here we propose a new NMR-based approach that employs a model of water diffusion within ``restricted'' cylindrical axons to estimate their diameter distribution within a nerve bundle. This approach can be combined with MRI to furnish an estimate of the axon diameter distribution within each voxel. This method is validated by comparing the diameter distributions measured using the NMR and histological techniques on sciatic and optic nerve tissue specimens. The axon diameter distribution measured in each voxel of porcine spinal cord using MRI and using histological methods were similar. Applications are expected in longitudinal studies designed to follow nerve growth in normal and abnormal development, as well as in diagnosing disorders and diseases affecting specific populations of axons in the CNS and PNS},

  abstract = {Purpose The paper introduces a classical model to describe the dynamics of large spin-1/2 ensembles associated with nuclei bound in large molecule structures, commonly referred to as the semi-solid spin pool, and their magnetization transfer (MT) to spins of nuclei in water. Theory and Methods Like quantum-mechanical descriptions of spin dynamics and like the original Bloch equations, but unlike existing MT models, the proposed model is based on the algebra of angular momentum in the sense that it explicitly models the rotations induced by radiofrequency (RF) pulses. It generalizes the original Bloch model to non-exponential decays, which are, for example, observed for semi-solid spin pools. The combination of rotations with non-exponential decays is facilitated by describing the latter as Green's functions, comprised in an integro-differential equation. Results Our model describes the data of an inversion-recovery magnetization-transfer experiment with varying durations of the inversion pulse substantially better than established models. We made this observation for all measured data, but in particular for pulse durations smaller than 300 {$\mu$}s. Furthermore, we provide a linear approximation of the generalized Bloch model that reduces the simulation time by approximately a factor 15,000, enabling simulation of the spin dynamics caused by a rectangular RF-pulse in roughly 2 {$\mu$}s. Conclusion The proposed theory unifies the original Bloch model, Henkelman's steady-state theory for MT, and the commonly assumed rotation induced by hard pulses (i.e., strong and infinitesimally short applications of RF-fields) and describes experimental data better than previous models.},

Also, the low rank approximation improves the conditioning of the problem, which is further improved by extending the low rank inverse problem to an augmented Lagrangian that is solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The root mean square error and the noise propagation are analyzed in simulations. For verification, in vivo examples are provided. Results The proposed low rank ADMM approach shows a reduced root mean square error compared to the original fingerprinting reconstruction, to a low rank approximation alone and to an ADMM approach without a low rank approximation. Incorporating sensitivity encoding allows for further artifact reduction. Conclusion The proposed reconstruction provides robust convergence, reduced computational burden and improved image quality compared to other MRF reconstruction approaches evaluated in this study.},

  abstract = {Six healthy volunteers and three patients with cardiac anomalies were studied in a comparison of segmented turboFLASH (fast low-angle shot) cine, a method of magnetic resonance imaging that permits an entire series of high-resolution cine images to be obtained in one breath hold, with standard cine. Segmented turboFLASH uses a gradient-echo sequence designed for short imaging times in combination with a segmented data acquisition method. Presaturation pulses were applied to eliminate the blood pool signal; the signal-to-noise ratio was assessed with a phantom. Standard hardware and image reconstruction methods were used. The breath-hold images consistently showed reduced ghosting and blurring from respiration. Because a very short echo time was used, segmented turboFLASH was relatively insensitive to dephasing caused by local field disturbances or flow. The authors conclude that, by reducing imaging times and eliminating respiratory artifact, segmented turboFLASH can be useful for performing cine studies of the heart and great vessels.},

We created the digital brain phantom that is at the heart of our publicly available database of realistic simulated magnetic resonance image (MRI) volumes known as BrainWeb. Even though the digital phantom had l mm(3) isotropic voxel size and a small number of tissue classes, the BrainWeb database has been used in more than one hundred peer-reviewed publications validating different image processing methods. In this paper, we describe the next step in the natural evolution of BrainWeb: the creation of digital brain phantom II that includes three major improvements over the original phantom. First, the realism of the phantom, and the resulting simulations, was improved by modeling more tissue classes to include blood vessels, bone marrow and dura mater classes. In addition. a more realistic skull class was created. The latter is particularly useful for SPECT, PET and CT simulations for which bone attenuation has an important effect. Second, the phantom was improved by an eight-fold reduction in voxel volume to 0.125 mm(3). Third, the method used to create the new phantom was modified not only to take into account the segmentation of these new structures, but also to take advantage of many more automated procedures now available. The overall process has reduced subjectivity and manual intervention when compared to the original phantom, and the process may be easily applied to create phantoms from other subjects. MRI simulations are shown to illustrate the difference between the previous and the new improved digital brain phantom II. Example PET and SPECT simulations are also presented.},

  abstract = {Simulations provide a way of generating data where ground truth is known, enabling quantitative testing of image processing methods. In this paper, we present the construction of 20 realistic digital brain phantoms that can be used to simulate medical imaging data. The phantoms are made from 20 normal adults to take into account intersubject anatomical variabilities. Each digital brain phantom was created by registering and averaging four T1, T2, and proton density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from each subject. A fuzzy minimum distance classification was used to classify voxel intensities from T1, T2, and PD average volumes into grey-matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, and fat. Automatically generated mask volumes were required to separate brain from nonbrain structures and ten fuzzy tissue volumes were created: grey matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, skull, marrow within the bone, dura, fat, tissue around the fat, muscles, and skin/muscles. A fuzzy vessel class was also obtained from the segmentation of the magnetic resonance angiography scan of the subject. These eleven fuzzy volumes that describe the spatial distribution of anatomical tissues define the digital phantom, where voxel intensity is proportional to the fraction of tissue within the voxel. These fuzzy volumes can be used to drive simulators for different modalities including MRI, PET, or SPECT. These phantoms were used to construct 20 simulated T1-weighted MR scans. To evaluate the realism of these simulations, we propose two approaches to compare them to real data acquired with the same acquisition parameters. The first approach consists of comparing the intensities within the segmented classes in both real and simulated data. In the second approach, a whole brain voxel-wise comparison between simulations and real T1-weighted data is performed. The first comparison underlines that segmented classes appear to properly represent the anatomy on average, and that inside these classes, the simulated and real intensity values are quite similar. The second comparison enables the study of the regional variations with no a priori class. The experiments demonstrate that these variations are small when real data are corrected for intensity nonuniformity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a renewed interest in lower field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), due to their favorable physical properties, reduced costs, and increased accessibility to patients with implants. We sought to assess the diagnostic capabilities of high-performance low-field (0.55 T) CMR imaging for quantification of right and left ventricular volumes and systolic function in both healthy subjects and patients referred for clinical CMR.  METHODS: Sixty-five subjects underwent paired exams at 1.5 T using a clinical CMR scanner and using an identical CMR~system modified to operate at 0.55 T. Volumetric coverage of the right ventricle (RV)~and left ventricles (LV)~was obtained using either a breath-held cine balanced steady-state free-precession acquisition or a motion-corrected free-breathing re-binned cine acquisition. Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare~LV and RV end-systolic volume~(ESV), end-diastolic volume~(EDV), ejection fraction~(EF), and~LV mass. Diagnostic confidence was scored on a Likert-type ordinal scale by blinded readers. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in LV and RV EDV~between the two scanners (e.g., LVEDV: p~=\,0.77, bias\,=\,0.40\,mL, correlation coefficient\,=\,0.99; RVEDV: p~=\,0.17, bias\,=\,-\,1.6\,mL, correlation coefficient\,=\,0.98), and regional wall motion abnormality scoring was similar (kappa 0.99). Blood-myocardium contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at 0.55\,T was 48\,{\textpm}\,7\% of the 1.5\,T CNR, and contrast was sufficient for endocardial segmentation in all cases. Diagnostic confidence of images was scored as "good" to "excellent" for the two field strengths in the majority of studies. CONCLUSION: A high-performance 0.55\,T system offers good bSSFP CMR image quality, and quantification of biventricular volumes and systolic function that is comparable to 1.5\,T in patients.

  abstract = {Purpose The dependence of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) eigenvalues and fractional anisotropy (FA) on short diffusion times was investigated using oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) and pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) DTI in the human brain in vivo. Theory and Methods DTI was performed in seven healthy volunteers at 4.7 Tesla (T) with b = 300 s/mm2 and diffusion times of 4.1 ms (OGSE 50 Hz), 7.4 ms (OGSE 25 Hz), 20 ms (PGSE), and 40 ms (PGSE). Eigenvalues and FA were compared in the corpus callosum body, splenium and genu, and the corticospinal, cingulum, inferior fronto-occipital, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi using tractography, and the thalamus and putamen using region-of-interest. Results Relative to 40 ms, the 4.1 ms diffusion time led to significant increases in DTI eigenvalues in seven white matter tracts (6\% to 20\% parallel, 13\% to 40\% perpendicular) and both deep gray matter regions (16\% parallel, 18\% to 26\% perpendicular), and reductions of FA (-9\% to -12\%) in four tracts. Conclusion DTI eigenvalues and FA depend on diffusion time in both white and gray matter in the human brain. The ability to target different length scales by means of the diffusion time may improve sensitivity to changes in tissue microstructure associated with pathology.

This class of methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

The choice of k-space trajectories is important in determining how off-resonance spins contribute to image artifacts. Top-down and center-out trajectories are theoretically analyzed, simulated, implemented, and tested in phantom and volunteer experiments. Theoretical results show off-resonance artifact manifests as a simple positional shift for the top-down trajectory, while for the center-out trajectory off-resonance artifact manifests as a splitting of the object, which entails both shift and blurring. These results were validated using simulation and phantom scan data where a frequency-offset was introduced ranging from --300 Hz to +300 Hz. As predicted by the theoretical results, inferior image quality was observed for the center-out trajectory in a single volunteer. Off-resonance produces more severe and complex artifacts with the center-out trajectory than the top-down trajectory.},

Writing efficient device code is challenging, and is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming language. We evaluate our approach by adding support for NVIDIA GPUs to the Julia programming language. By integrating with the existing compiler, we significantly lower the cost to implement and maintain the new compiler, and facilitate reuse of existing application code. Moreover, use of the high-level Julia programming language enables new and dynamic approaches for GPU programming. This greatly improves programmer productivity, while maintaining application performance similar to that of the official NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.},

This has led to an influx of non-expert programmers, who need to use and program high-performance computing platforms. With the continued stagnation of single-threaded performance, using hardware accelerators such as GPUs or FPGAs is necessary. Adapting software to these compute platforms is a difficult task, especially for non-expert programmers, leading to applications being unable to take advantage of new hardware or requiring extensive rewrites. We propose a programming model that allows non-experts to benefit from high-performance computing, while enabling expert programmers to take full advantage of the underlying hardware. In this model, programs are generically typed, the location of the data is encoded in the type system, and multiple dispatch is used to select functionality based on the type of the data. This enables rapid prototyping, retargeting and reuse of existing software, while allowing for hardware specific optimization if required. Our approach allows development to happen in one source language enabling domain experts and performance engineers to jointly develop a program, without the overhead, friction, and challenges associated with developing in multiple programming languages for the same project. We demonstrate the viability and the core principles of this programming model in Julia using realistic examples, showing the potential of this approach for rapid prototyping, and its applicability for real-life engineering. We focus on usability for non-expert programmers and demonstrate that the potential of the underlying hardware can be fully exploited.},

  abstract = {Balanced steady state free precession (balanced SSFP) has become increasingly popular for research and clinical applications, offering a very high signal-to-noise ratio and a T2/T1-weighted image contrast. This review article gives an overview on the basic principles of this fast imaging technique as well as possibilities for contrast modification. The first part focuses on the fundamental principles of balanced SSFP signal formation in the transient phase and in the steady state. In the second part, balanced SSFP imaging, contrast, and basic mechanisms for contrast modification are revisited and contemporary clinical applications are discussed. J. Magn. Reson.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce the wave-CAIPI (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) acquisition and reconstruction technique for highly accelerated 3D imaging with negligible g-factor and artifact penalties. METHODS: The wave-CAIPI 3D acquisition involves playing sinusoidal gy and gz gradients during the readout of each kx encoding line while modifying the 3D phase encoding strategy to incur interslice shifts as in 2D-CAIPI acquisitions. The resulting acquisition spreads the aliasing evenly in all spatial directions, thereby taking full advantage of 3D coil sensitivity distribution. By expressing the voxel spreading effect as a convolution in image space, an efficient reconstruction scheme that does not require data gridding is proposed. Rapid acquisition and high-quality image reconstruction with wave-CAIPI is demonstrated for high-resolution magnitude and phase imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping. RESULTS: Wave-CAIPI enables full-brain gradient echo acquisition at 1 mm isotropic voxel size and R = 3 {\texttimes} 3 acceleration with maximum g-factors of 1.08 at 3T and 1.05 at 7T. Relative to the other advanced Cartesian encoding strategies (2D-CAIPI and bunched phase encoding) wave-CAIPI yields up to two-fold reduction in maximum g-factor for nine-fold acceleration at both field strengths. CONCLUSION: Wave-CAIPI allows highly accelerated 3D acquisitions with low artifact and negligible g-factor penalties, and may facilitate clinical application of high-resolution volumetric imaging.},

In order to have a theoretical understanding in the most general case, we have conceived a computer program for the simulation of NMR imaging techniques. The algorithm uses the solution of the Bloch equations at each point of a simulated object. The direction of every elementary magnetic moment is computed at each instant, and stored in an array giving the global signal to be processed, whatever the pulse and gradient sequence. To test the validity of this program, we have simulated some well-known experimental results. Some applications are presented which contribute to the understanding of image distortions and to techniques such as selective radio-frequency pulse or oscillating gradients. This program can be used to unravel physical and technological causes of image distortions, to have a "microscopic" look at any parameter of an experiment, and to study the contrast given by various NMR imaging techniques as a function of the three NMR parameters, i.e., the hydrogen nuclei density rho and the relaxation times T1 and T2.},

This is a convex program and we demonstrate a solution algorithm whose computational complexity is roughly comparable to that of classical {$\ell$}1 procedures such as the Lasso. Here, the regularizer is a sorted {$\ell$}1 norm, which penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rank---that is, stronger the signal---the larger the penalty. This is similar to the Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289--300] procedure (BH) which compares more significant p-values with more stringent thresholds. One notable choice of the sequence \{{$\lambda$}i\} is given by the BH critical values  {$\lambda$}BH(i)=z(1-i{$\cdot$}q/2p), where q {$\in$} (0, 1) and z({$\alpha$}) is the quantile of a standard normal distribution. SLOPE aims to provide finite sample guarantees on the selected model; of special interest is the false discovery rate (FDR), defined as the expected proportion of irrelevant regressors among all selected predictors. Under orthogonal designs, SLOPE with {$\lambda$}BH provably controls FDR at level q. Moreover, it also appears to have appreciable inferential properties under more general designs X while having substantial power, as demonstrated in a series of experiments running on both simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping is a technique to estimate the magnetic property of tissue with particularly high sensitivity at ultra-high field. However, a key challenge at ultra-high field is the combination of phase data acquired using phased array receive coils. Several methods for combining phase data have been proposed, but the influence of coil combination choices on susceptibility quantitation has not been studied systematically. METHODS: We combined phase data using COMPOSER (COMbining Phase data using a Short Echo-time Reference scan) and a reference-free channel-by-channel method. We investigated the effect of the chosen combination method on susceptibility results in a group of 28 participants at 7 Tesla. RESULTS: Our results show that reference scans can bias susceptibility values. Although the proposed reference-free channel-by-channel method cannot remove transmit field phase, it shows comparable results to the COMPOSER method in which a high-resolution ultrashort echo-time reference scan was used. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ultrashort echo-time reference scans reduce quantitation bias and remove the transmit field phase when using COMPOSER to combine phase data, and not combining the phase data before susceptibility processing avoids this bias, resulting in comparable results.

In this study a new approach termed "controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration" (CAIPIRINHA) is presented. This technique modifies the appearance of aliasing artifacts during the acquisition to improve the subsequent parallel image reconstruction procedure. This new parallel multi-slice technique is more efficient compared to other multi-slice parallel imaging concepts that use only a pure postprocessing approach. In this new approach, multiple slices of arbitrary thickness and distance are excited simultaneously with the use of multi-band radiofrequency (RF) pulses similar to Hadamard pulses. These data are then undersampled, yielding superimposed slices that appear shifted with respect to each other. The shift of the aliased slices is controlled by modulating the phase of the individual slices in the multi-band excitation pulse from echo to echo. We show that the reconstruction quality of the aliased slices is better using this shift. This may potentially allow one to use higher acceleration factors than are used in techniques without this excitation scheme. Additionally, slices that have essentially the same coil sensitivity profiles can be separated with this technique.},

This 3D motion-corrected undersampled signal matched (MUST) T2 map is achieved by combining an undersampled motion-compensated T2 -prepared Cartesian acquisition with a high-order patch-based reconstruction. METHODS: The 3D MUST-T2 mapping acquisition consists of an electrocardiogram-triggered, T2 -prepared, balanced SSFP sequence with nonselective saturation pulses. Three undersampled T2 -weighted volumes are acquired using a 3D Cartesian variable-density sampling with increasing T2 preparation times. A 2D image-based navigator is used to correct for respiratory motion of the heart and allow 100\% scan efficiency. Multicontrast high-dimensionality undersampled patch-based reconstruction is used in concert with dictionary matching to generate 3D T2 maps. The proposed framework was evaluated in simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo (10 healthy subjects, 2 patients) with 1.5-mm3 isotropic resolution. Three-dimensional MUST-T2 was compared against standard multi-echo spin-echo sequence (phantom) and conventional breath-held single-shot 2D SSFP T2 mapping (in vivo). RESULTS: Three-dimensional MUST-T2 showed high accuracy in phantom experiments (R2 {$>$} 0.99). The precision of T2 values was similar for 3D MUST-T2 and 2D balanced SSFP T2 mapping in vivo (5 {\textpm} 1 ms versus 4 {\textpm} 2 ms, P = .52). Slightly longer T2 values were observed with 3D MUST-T2 in comparison to 2D balanced SSFP T2 mapping (50.7 {\textpm} 2 ms versus 48.2 {\textpm} 1 ms, P {$<$} .05). Preliminary results in patients demonstrated T2 values in agreement with literature values. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach enables free-breathing whole-heart 3D T2 mapping with high isotropic resolution in about 8 minutes, achieving accurate and precise T2 quantification of myocardial tissue in a clinically feasible scan time.},

Results Phantom and in vivo (1.2 mm3) reconstructions were in excellent agreement with the reference fully sampled image. In vivo average acquisition times (min:s) were 7:57 {\textpm} 1:18 ({\texttimes}5) and 4:35 {\textpm} 0:44 ({\texttimes}9) for 0.9 mm3 resolution. Sub-millimeter 3D-PROST resulted in excellent depiction of the left and right coronary arteries including small branch vessels, leading to further improvements in vessel sharpness and visible vessel length in comparison with conventional reconstruction techniques.

  abstract = {Purpose To develop a new high-dimensionality undersampled patch-based reconstruction (HD-PROST) for highly accelerated 2D and 3D multi-contrast MRI. Methods HD-PROST jointly reconstructs multi-contrast MR images by exploiting the highly redundant information, on a local and non-local scale, and the strong correlation shared between the multiple contrast images. This is achieved by enforcing multi-dimensional low-rank in the undersampled images. 2D magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) phantom and in vivo brain acquisitions were performed to evaluate the performance of HD-PROST for highly accelerated simultaneous T1 and T2 mapping. Additional in vivo experiments for reconstructing multiple undersampled 3D magnetization transfer (MT)-weighted images were conducted to illustrate the impact of HD-PROST for high-resolution multi-contrast 3D imaging. Results In the 2D MRF phantom study, HD-PROST provided accurate and precise estimation of the T1 and T2 values in comparison to gold standard spin echo acquisitions. HD-PROST achieved good quality maps for the in vivo 2D MRF experiments in comparison to conventional low-rank inversion reconstruction. T1 and T2 values of white matter and gray matter were in good agreement with those reported in the literature for MRF acquisitions with reduced number of time point images (500 time point images, 2.5 s scan time). For in vivo MT-weighted 3D acquisitions (6 different contrasts), HD-PROST achieved similar image quality than the fully sampled reference image for an undersampling factor of 6.5-fold. Conclusion HD-PROST enables multi-contrast 2D and 3D MR images in a short acquisition time without compromising image quality. Ultimately, this technique may increase the potential of conventional parameter mapping.},

The method, which derives from the multiple propagator approach of A. Caprihanet al.(1996,J. Magn. Reson. A118,94), depends on the representation of the gradient waveform by a succession of sharp gradient impulses. It leads toE(q) being expressed as a product of matrix operators corresponding quite naturally to the successive sandwich of phase evolution and Brownian migration events. Simple expressions are given for the case of the finite width gradient pulse PGSE experiment, the CPMG pulse train used in frequency-domain modulated gradient spin echo NMR, and the case of a sinusoidal waveform. The finite width gradient pulse PGSE and CPMG pulse trains are evaluated for the case of restricted diffusion between parallel reflecting planes. The former results agree precisely with published computer simulations while the latter calculation provides useful insight regarding the spectral density approach to impeded Brownian motion.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: MR fingerprinting (MRF) is a versatile method for rapid multi-parametric quantification. The application of MRF for lower MRI field could enable multi-contrast imaging and improve exam efficiency on these systems. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of 3D whole-brain T1 and T2 mapping using MR fingerprinting on a contemporary 0.55~T MRI system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3D whole brain stack-of-spirals FISP MRF sequence was implemented for 0.55~T. Quantification was validated using the NIST/ISMRM Quantitative MRI phantom, and T1 and T2 values of white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid were measured in 19 healthy subjects. To assess MRF performance in the lower SNR regime of 0.55~T, measurement precision was calculated from 100 simulated pseudo-replicas of in vivo data and within-session measurement repeatability was evaluated. RESULTS: T1 and T2 values calculated by MRF were strongly correlated to standard measurements in the ISMRM/NIST MRI system phantom (R2~{$>~$}0.99), with a small constant bias of approximately 5~ms in T2 values. 3D stack-of-spirals MRF was successfully applied for whole brain quantitative T1 and T2 at 0.55~T, with spatial resolution of 1.2~mm~{\texttimes}~1.2~mm~{\texttimes}~5~mm, and acquisition time of 8.5~min. Moreover, the T1 and T2 quantifications had precision {$<$}5\%, despite the lower SNR of 0.55~T. CONCLUSION: A 3D whole-brain stack-of-spirals FISP MRF sequence is feasible for T1 and T2 mapping at 0.55~T.},

The goals of this workshop were to discuss recent low field MRI technology including hardware and software developments, novel methodology, new contrast mechanisms, as well as the clinical translation and dissemination of these systems. The virtual Workshop was attended by 368 registrants from 24 countries, and included 34 invited talks, 100 abstract presentations, 2 panel discussions, and 2 live scanner demonstrations. Here, we report on the scientific content of the Workshop and identify the key themes that emerged. The subject matter of the Workshop reflected the ongoing developments of low-field MRI as an accessible imaging modality that may expand the usage of MRI through cost reduction, portability, and ease of installation. Many talks in this Workshop addressed the use of computational power, efficient acquisitions, and contemporary hardware to overcome the SNR limitations associated with low field strength. Participants discussed the selection of appropriate clinical applications that leverage the unique capabilities of low-field MRI within traditional radiology practices, other point-of-care settings, and the broader community. The notion of ``image quality'' versus ``information content'' was also discussed, as images from low-field portable systems that are purpose-built for clinical decision-making may not replicate the current standard of clinical imaging. Speakers also described technical challenges and infrastructure challenges related to portability and widespread dissemination, and speculated about future directions for the field to improve the technology and establish clinical value.},

  abstract = {Background Commercial low-field-strength MRI systems are generally not equipped with state-of-the-art MRI hardware, and are not suitable for demanding imaging techniques. An MRI system was developed that combines low field strength (0.55 T) with high-performance imaging technology. Purpose To evaluate applications of a high-performance low-field-strength MRI system, specifically MRI-guided cardiovascular catheterizations with metallic devices, diagnostic imaging in high-susceptibility regions, and efficient image acquisition strategies. Materials and Methods A commercial 1.5-T MRI system was modified to operate at 0.55 T while maintaining high-performance hardware, shielded gradients (45 mT/m; 200 T/m/sec), and advanced imaging methods. MRI was performed between January 2018 and April 2019. T1, T2, and T2* were measured at 0.55 T; relaxivity of exogenous contrast agents was measured; and clinical applications advantageous at low field were evaluated. Results There were 83 0.55-T MRI examinations performed in study participants (45 women; mean age, 34 years {\textpm} 13). On average, T1 was 32\% shorter, T2 was 26\% longer, and T2* was 40\% longer at 0.55 T compared with 1.5 T. Nine metallic interventional devices were found to be intrinsically safe at 0.55 T ({$<$}1{$^\circ$}C heating) and MRI-guided right heart catheterization was performed in seven study participants with commercial metallic guidewires. Compared with 1.5 T, reduced image distortion was shown in lungs, upper airway, cranial sinuses, and intestines because of improved field homogeneity. Oxygen inhalation generated lung signal enhancement of 19\% {\textpm} 11 (standard deviation) at 0.55 T compared with 7.6\% {\textpm} 6.3 at 1.5 T (P = .02; five participants) because of the increased T1 relaxivity of oxygen (4.7e-4 mmHg-1sec-1). Efficient spiral image acquisitions were amenable to low field strength and generated increased signal-to-noise ratio compared with Cartesian acquisitions (P {$<$} .02). Representative imaging of the brain, spine, abdomen, and heart generated good image quality with this system. Conclusion This initial study suggests that high-performance low-field-strength MRI offers advantages for MRI-guided catheterizations with metal devices, MRI in high-susceptibility regions, and efficient imaging. {\copyright} RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

  abstract = {Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is appealing to guide complex cardiac procedures because it is ionizing radiation-free and offers flexible soft-tissue contrast. Interventional cardiac MR promises to improve existing procedures and enable new ones for complex arrhythmias, as well as congenital and structural heart disease. Guiding invasive procedures demands faster image acquisition, reconstruction and analysis, as well as intuitive intraprocedural display of imaging data. Standard cardiac MR techniques such as 3D anatomical imaging, cardiac function and flow, parameter mapping, and late-gadolinium enhancement can be used to gather valuable clinical data at various procedural stages. Rapid intraprocedural image analysis can extract and highlight critical information about interventional targets and outcomes. In some cases, real-time interactive imaging is used to provide a continuous stream of images displayed to interventionalists for dynamic device navigation. Alternatively, devices are navigated relative to a roadmap of major cardiac structures generated through fast segmentation and registration. Interventional devices can be visualized and tracked throughout a procedure with specialized imaging methods. In a clinical setting, advanced imaging must be integrated with other clinical tools and patient data. In order to perform these complex procedures, interventional cardiac MR relies on customized equipment, such as interactive imaging environments, in-room image display, audio communication, hemodynamic monitoring and recording systems, and electroanatomical mapping and ablation systems. Operating in this sophisticated environment requires coordination and planning. This review provides an overview of the imaging technology used in MRI-guided cardiac interventions. Specifically, this review outlines clinical targets, standard image acquisition and analysis tools, and the integration of these tools into clinical workflow.

Here, A is an m by n (coding) matrix and e is an arbitrary and unknown vector of errors. Is it possible to recover f exactly from the data y?

In short, f can be recovered exactly by solving a simple convex optimization problem (which one can recast as a linear program). In addition, numerical experiments suggest that this recovery procedure works unreasonably well; f is recovered exactly even in situations where a significant fraction of the output is corrupted. This work is related to the problem of finding sparse solutions to vastly underdetermined systems of linear equations. There are also significant connections with the problem of recovering signals from highly incomplete measurements. In fact, the results introduced in this paper improve on our earlier work. Finally, underlying the success of {$\ell$}1 is a crucial property we call the uniform uncertainty principle that we shall describe in detail.},

In this paper, we study a novel method for sparse signal recovery that in many situations outperforms {$\ell$}1 minimization in the sense that substantially fewer measurements are needed for exact recovery. The algorithm consists of solving a sequence of weighted {$\ell$}1-minimization problems where the weights used for the next iteration are computed from the value of the current solution. We present a series of experiments demonstrating the remarkable performance and broad applicability of this algorithm in the areas of sparse signal recovery, statistical estimation, error correction and image processing. Interestingly, superior gains are also achieved when our method is applied to recover signals with assumed near-sparsity in overcomplete representations---not by reweighting the {$\ell$}1 norm of the coefficient sequence as is common, but by reweighting the {$\ell$}1 norm of the transformed object. An immediate consequence is the possibility of highly efficient data acquisition protocols by improving on a technique known as Compressive Sensing.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f{$\in$}CN and a randomly chosen set of frequencies {\textohm}. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set {\textohm}? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of {\textbar}T{\textbar} spikes f(t)={$\sigma\tau\in$}Tf({$\tau$}){$\delta$}(t-{$\tau$}) obeying {\textbar}T{\textbar}{$\leq$}CM{$\cdot$}(log N)-1 {$\cdot$} {\textbar}{\textohm}{\textbar} for some constant CM{$>$}0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N-M), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the {$\ell$}1 minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for CM which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of {\textbar}T{\textbar} spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O({\textbar}T{\textbar}{$\cdot$}logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to {\textbar}T{\textbar}{$\cdot$}logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

Most of them are extracellular agents which create different enhancement on basis of different vascularization or on basis of different interstitial network in tissues, but some can be targeted to a particular cell line (e.g. hepatocyte). Microbubbles can be used as carrier for therapeutic drugs which can be released in specific targets under sonographic guidance, decreasing systemic toxicity and increasing therapeutic effect. Radiologists have to choose a particular contrast agent knowing its physical and chemical properties and the possibility of adverse reactions and balancing them with the clinical benefits of a more accurate diagnosis. As for any drug, contrast agents can cause adverse events, which are more frequent with Iodine based CA, but also with Gd based CA and even with sonographic contrast agents hypersensitivity reaction can occur.},

Direct application of this sequence to 0.55T is not possible due to changes in the magnetic properties of the tissues. To enable free-breathing CMRA at 0.55T, pulse sequence design and acquisition parameters of a previously proposed whole-heart CMRA framework are optimized via Bloch simulations.

  abstract = {Purpose To develop an open-source, high-performance, easy-to-use, extensible, cross-platform, and general MRI simulation framework (Koma). Methods Koma was developed using the Julia programming language. Like other MRI simulators, it solves the Bloch equations with CPU and GPU parallelization. The inputs are the scanner parameters, the phantom, and the pulse sequence that is Pulseq-compatible. The raw data is stored in the ISMRMRD format. For the reconstruction, MRIReco.jl is used. A graphical user interface utilizing web technologies was also designed. Two types of experiments were performed: one to compare the quality of the results and the execution speed, and the second to compare its usability. Finally, the use of Koma in quantitative imaging was demonstrated by simulating Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) acquisitions. Results Koma was compared to two well-known open-source MRI simulators, JEMRIS and MRiLab. Highly accurate results (with mean absolute differences below 0.1\% compared to JEMRIS) and better GPU performance than MRiLab were demonstrated. In an experiment with students, Koma was proved to be easy to use, eight times faster on personal computers than JEMRIS, and 65\% of test subjects recommended it. The potential for designing acquisition and reconstruction techniques was also shown through the simulation of MRF acquisitions, with conclusions that agree with the literature. Conclusions Koma's speed and flexibility have the potential to make simulations more accessible for education and research. Koma is expected to be used for designing and testing novel pulse sequences before implementing them in the scanner with Pulseq files, and for creating synthetic data to train machine learning models.},

Furthermore, certain other diseases affecting the cardiovascular system remain prevalent and important causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in developing countries, including the cardiac effects of rheumatic heart disease and the vascular effects of malaria. Imaging and functional studies of early cardiovascular changes in those disease processes have also recently been published by various groups, allowing consideration of screening and early treatment opportunities.

  abstract = {Myelin water fraction (MWF) mapping based on data fitting of a 3-pool exponential model of multi-echo gradient echo (mGRE) data using MRI shows great promises for in vivo myelin quantification. However, this multi-exponential fitting is ill-conditioned because of the similar relaxation times and frequency shifts of the various compartments. Additionally, the bound water residing in the myelin sheath of white matter is expected to have a faster longitudinal magnetisation recovery than that of the free water in the intra-axonal and extra-axonal space. When the Ernst angle is used to achieve maximum SNR and improve fitting, this will introduce a T1-weighting effect to the derived MWF. In this study, we first demonstrate that diffusion-weighted imaging can be used to infer the compartmental signal properties using an analytical fibre model to achieve a robust MWF estimation. Second, we show that by incorporating a variable flip angle scheme to the mGRE acquisition with a multi-compartment relaxometry model, not only the MWF is corrected from the T1 dependency but also the fitting procedure becomes less ill-conditioned and more SNR efficient. Finally, we demonstrate these two approaches can be combined to allow higher spatial resolution MWF maps than what has been reported to date with robust MWF estimation on a small cohort.},

ECG-gated CT angiography (CTA) plays an important role in the preoperative planning for these devices. As the number of patients undergoing these procedures increases, a subset of patients is being recognized who have contraindications to iodinated contrast medium, either due to a prior severe allergic type reaction or poor renal function. Another subgroup of patients with low flow and low gradient aortic stenosis is being recognized that are usually assessed for severity of aortic stenosis by stress echocardiography. There are contraindications to stress echocardiography and some of these patients may not be able to undergo this test. Non-contrast MRI can be a useful emerging modality for evaluating these patients. In this article, we discuss the emerging indications of non-contrast MRI in preoperative assessment for TAVI and describe the commonly used MRI sequences. A comparison of the most important measurements obtained for TAVI assessment on CTA and MRI from same subjects is included. Teaching Points {$\bullet$} MRI can be used for preoperative assessment of aortic annulus. {$\bullet$} MRI is an alternate to CTA when iodinated contrast is contraindicated. {$\bullet$} Measurements obtained by non-contrast MRI are similar to contrast enhanced CTA. {$\bullet$} MRI can be used to assess severity of aortic stenosis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate a new saturation recovery single-shot acquisition (SASHA) pulse sequence for T1 mapping and to compare SASHA T1 values in heart failure patients and healthy controls. THEORY: The SASHA sequence consists of 10 electrocardiogram-triggered single-shot balanced steady-state free precession images in a breath-hold. The first image is acquired without magnetization preparation and the remaining nine images follow saturation pulses with variable saturation recovery times. METHODS: SASHA was validated through Bloch equation simulations, Monte Carlo simulations, and phantom experiments. Pre- and postcontrast myocardial and blood T1 values were measured in 29 healthy volunteers and 7 patients with heart failure. RESULTS: SASHA T1 values had excellent agreement (bias, 5 {\textpm} 5 ms) with spin echo experiments in phantoms with a wide range of physiologic T1 and T2 values and its accuracy was independent of flip angle, absolute T1 , T2 , and heart rate. The average baseline myocardial T1 in heart failure patients was higher than in healthy controls (1200 {\textpm} 32 vs. 1170 {\textpm} 9 ms, P {$<$} 0.05) at 1.5T, as was the calculated blood-tissue partition coefficient, {$\lambda$}, (0.42 {\textpm} 0.04 vs. 0.38 {\textpm} 0.02, P {$<$} 0.05), consistent with diffuse myocardial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The SASHA sequence is a simple and fast approach to in vivo T1 mapping with good accuracy in simulations and phantom experiments.},

  abstract = {Quantitative cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can be used to characterize fibrosis, oedema, ischaemia, inflammation and other disease conditions. However, the need to reduce artefacts arising from body motion through a combination of electrocardiography (ECG) control, respiration control, and contrast-weighting selection makes CMR exams lengthy. Here, we show that physiological motions and other dynamic processes can be conceptualized as multiple time dimensions that can be resolved via low-rank tensor imaging, allowing for motion-resolved quantitative imaging with up to four time dimensions. This continuous-acquisition approach, which we name cardiovascular MR multitasking, captures - rather than avoids - motion, relaxation and other dynamics to efficiently perform quantitative CMR without the use of ECG triggering or breath holds. We demonstrate that CMR multitasking allows for T1 mapping, T1-T2 mapping and time-resolved T1 mapping of myocardial perfusion without ECG information and/or in free-breathing conditions. CMR multitasking may provide a foundation for the development of setup-free CMR imaging for the quantitative evaluation of cardiovascular health.},

  abstract = {In MR Fingerprinting (MRF), balanced Steady-State Free Precession (bSSFP) has advantages over unbalanced SSFP because it retains the spin history achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and scan efficiency. However, bSSFP-MRF is not frequently used because it is sensitive to off-resonance, producing artifacts and blurring, and affecting the parametric map quality. Here we propose a novel Spatial Off-resonance Correction (SOC) approach for reducing these artifacts in bSSFP-MRF with spiral trajectories. SOC-MRF uses each pixel's Point Spread Function to create system matrices that encode both off-resonance and gridding effects. We iteratively compute the inverse of these matrices to reduce the artifacts. We evaluated the proposed method using brain simulations and actual MRF acquisitions of a standardized T1/T2 phantom and five healthy subjects. The results show that the off-resonance distortions in T1/T2 maps were considerably reduced using SOC-MRF. For T2, the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) was reduced from 17.3 to 8.3\% (simulations) and from 35.1 to 14.9\% (phantom). For T1, the NRMS was reduced from 14.7 to 7.7\% (simulations) and from 17.7 to 6.7\% (phantom). For in-vivo, the mean and standard deviation in different ROI in white and gray matter were significantly improved. For example, SOC-MRF estimated an average T2 for white matter of 77ms (the ground truth was 74ms) versus 50 ms of MRF. For the same example the standard deviation was reduced from 18 ms to 6ms. The corrections achieved with the proposed SOC-MRF may expand the potential applications of bSSFP-MRF, taking advantage of its better SNR property.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an accelerated and nonrigid motion-compensated technique for efficient isotropic 3D whole-heart coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) with Cartesian acquisition. METHODS: Highly efficient whole-heart 3D CMRA was achieved by combining image reconstruction from undersampled data using compressed sensing (CS) with a nonrigid motion compensation framework. Undersampled acquisition was performed using a variable-density Cartesian trajectory with radial order (VD-CAPR). Motion correction was performed in two steps: beat-to-beat 2D translational correction with motion estimated from interleaved image navigators, and bin-to-bin 3D nonrigid correction with motion estimated from respiratory-resolved images reconstructed from undersampled 3D CMRA data using CS. Nonrigid motion fields were incorporated into an undersampled motion-compensated reconstruction, which combines CS with the general matrix description formalism. The proposed approach was tested on 10 healthy subjects and compared against a conventional twofold accelerated 5-mm navigator-gated and tracked acquisition. RESULTS: The proposed method achieves isotropic 1.2-mm Cartesian whole-heart CMRA in 5 min {\textpm} 1 min ({\textasciitilde}8{\texttimes} acceleration). The proposed approach provides good-quality images of the left and right coronary arteries, comparable to those of a twofold accelerated navigator-gated and tracked acquisition, but scan time was up to about four times faster. For both coronaries, no significant differences (P {$>$} 0.05) in vessel sharpness and length were found between the proposed method and reference scan. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of a highly efficient motion-compensated reconstruction framework for accelerated 3D CMRA has been demonstrated in healthy subjects. Further investigation is required to assess the clinical value of the method.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled non-invasive myocardial tissue characterization in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases by quantifying several tissue specific parameters such as T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times. Simultaneous assessment of these parameters has recently gained interest to potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and enable further understanding of the underlying disease. However, these quantitative maps are usually acquired sequentially and are not necessarily co-registered, making multi-parametric analysis challenging. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been recently introduced to unify and streamline parametric mapping into a single simultaneous, multi-parametric, fully co-registered, and efficient scan. Feasibility of cardiac MRF has been demonstrated and initial clinical validation studies are ongoing. Provide an overview of the cardiac MRF framework, recent technical developments and initial undergoing clinical validation. Recent Findings Cardiac MRF has enabled the acquisition of co-registered T1 and T2 maps in a single, efficient scan. Initial results demonstrate feasibility of cardiac MRF in healthy subjects and small patient cohorts. Current in vivo results show a small bias and comparable precision in T1 and T2 with respect to conventional clinical parametric mapping approaches. This bias may be explained by several confounding factors such as magnetization transfer and field inhomogeneities, which are currently not included in the cardiac MRF model. Initial clinical validation for cardiac MRF has demonstrated good reproducibility in healthy subjects and heart transplant patients, reduced artifacts in inflammatory cardiomyopathy patients and good differentiation between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and healthy controls. Summary Cardiac MRF has emerged as a novel technique for simultaneous, multi-parametric, and co-registered mapping of different tissue parameters. Initial efforts have focused on enabling T1, T2, and fat quantification; however this approach has the potential of enabling quantification of several other parameters (such as T2*, diffusion, perfusion, and flow) from a single scan. Initial results in healthy subjects and patients are promising, thus further clinical validation is now warranted.},

MR angiograms were compared with those obtained with conventional, end-expiratory breath holding. RESULTS: Navigator gating with correction resulted in image quality equivalent to that obtained with breath holding, even with the 7-mm gating window. In contrast, navigator gating without correction allowed only maintenance of image quality similar to that obtained with breath holding for the 3- and 5-mm windows and resulted in decreased image quality with the 7-mm window (P {$<$} .05). Use of navigator gating with correction and the 7-mm window resulted in a 28\% decrease in imaging time compared with breath holding and a 33\% decrease compared with the 3-mm gating window (P {$<$} .05 for both comparisons). CONCLUSION: Prospective, adaptive navigator correction of image position for free-breathing coronary MR angiography is a promising, novel approach to compensate for respiratory motion.},

We propose a novel MRI framework to quantify the microscopic heterogeneity of the living human brain as spatially resolved five-dimensional relaxation--diffusion distributions by augmenting a conventional diffusion-weighted imaging sequence with signal encoding principles from multidimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, relaxation--diffusion correlation methods from Laplace NMR of porous media, and Monte Carlo data inversion. The high dimensionality of the distribution space allows resolution of multiple microscopic environments within each heterogeneous voxel as well as their individual characterization with novel statistical measures that combine the chemical sensitivity of the relaxation rates with the link between microstructure and the anisotropic diffusivity of tissue water.

The major task was to optimize an appropriate magnetization preparation scheme to permit saturation of the epicardial fat signal. An alpha/2 preparation pulse was used to speed up the approach to steady-state following a frequency-selective fat-saturation pulse in each heartbeat. The application of dummy cycles was found to reduce the oscillation of the magnetization during data acquisition. The fat saturation and magnetization preparation scheme was validated with simulations and phantom studies. Volunteer studies demonstrated substantially increased SNR (55\%) and CNR (178\%) for coronary arteries compared to FLASH (fast low-angle shot) with the same imaging time.

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a noninvasive method of imaging brain function in vivo. However, images produced in FMRI experiments are imperfect and contain several artifacts that contaminate the data. These artifacts include rigid-body motion effects, B0-field inhomogeneities, chemical shift, and eddy currents. To investigate these artifacts, with the eventual aim of minimizing or removing them completely, a computational model of the FMR image acquisition process was built that can simulate all of the above-mentioned artifacts. This paper gives an overview of the development of the FMRI simulator. The simulator uses the Bloch equations together with a geometric definition of the object (brain) and a varying T model for the BOLD activations. Furthermore, it simulates rigid-body motion of the object by solving Bloch equations for given motion parameters that are defined for an object moving continuously in time, including during the read-out period, which is a novel approach in the area of MRI computer simulations. With this approach it is possible, in a controlled and precise way, to simulate the full effects of various rigid-body motion artifacts in FMRI data (e.g. spin-history effects, B0-motion interaction, and within-scan motion blurring) and therefore formulate and test algorithms for their reduction.

  abstract = {Transient magnetic fields induce changes in magnetic resonance (MR) images ranging from small, visually undetectable effects (caused, for instance, by neuronal currents) to more significant ones, such as those created by the gradient fields and eddy currents. Accurately simulating these effects may assist in correcting or optimising MR imaging for many applications (e.g., diffusion imaging, current density imaging, use of magnetic contrast agents, neuronal current imaging, etc.). Here we have extended an existing MR simulator (POSSUM) with a model for changing magnetic fields at a very high-resolution time-scale. This simulator captures a realistic range of scanner and physiological artifacts by modeling the scanner environment, pulse sequence details and subject properties (e.g., brain geometry and air-tissue boundaries). The simulations were validated by using previously published experimental data sets. In the first dataset a transient magnetic field was produced by a single conducting wire with varying current amplitude (between 17 {$\mu$}A and 765 {$\mu$}A). The second was identical except that current amplitude was fixed (at 7.8 mA) and current timing varied. A very close match between simulated images and experimental data was observed. In addition, these validation results led to the observation that the current-induced effects included ringing in the image, which extended away from the conductor, primarily in the phase-encode direction. This effect had previously not been noticed in the noisy, experimentally-acquired images, demonstrating one way in which simulated images can provide potential insight into imaging experiments.},

The signal intensity of stationary tissue decreased as the power applied for the MTC pulse was increased. A smaller decrease occurred in venous signal intensity as measured in the superior sagittal sinus, and less change was seen in the arterial signal intensity as measured in the middle cerebral artery. Cerebrospinal fluid showed no MTC effect. The use of MTC improved small-vessel depiction on maximum-intensity projection images.

Here, a new approach is introduced to efficiently engineer any tissue type, which its differentiation cues are known, from one small tissue biopsy. Pieces of omental tissues are extracted from patients and, while the cells are reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells, the extracellular matrix is processed into an immunologically matching, thermoresponsive hydrogel. Efficient cell differentiation within a large 3D hydrogel is reported, and, as a proof of concept, the generation of functional cardiac, cortical, spinal cord, and adipogenic tissue implants is demonstrated. This versatile bioengineering approach may assist to regenerate any tissue and organ with a minimal risk for immune rejection.},

A set of algorithms that can reverse the effects of object displacements and phase shifts was used. These algorithms essentially transfer the frame of reference of the image reconstruction from the static frame of the imager couch to the moving "visceral frame." An accurate record of tissue motion during image acquisition is required. To achieve this, the authors used specially encoded "navigator" echoes that are interleaved with the imaging sequence. Postprocessing of the navigator echo data provides a highly detailed record of the displacements and phase shifts that occur during imaging. Phantom studies demonstrated that the technique can directly correct image degradation caused by motion. In contrast to conventional artifact reduction techniques, such as ordered phase encoding and gradient moment nulling, this new method has a unique capacity to reduce motion unsharpness. Preliminary in vivo studies have demonstrated that the technique can markedly improve images degraded by voluntary motion and shows promise for addressing the problem of respiratory motion in thoracoabdominal imaging.},

Methods Gradient-echo brain imaging is performed on a 7 T system using high-resolution single-shot spiral readouts and half-shot spirals that perform dual-image acquisition after a single excitation. Image reconstruction is based on an expanded signal model including the encoding effects of coil sensitivity, static off-resonance, and magnetic field dynamics. The latter are recorded concurrently with image acquisition, using NMR field probes. The resulting image resolution is assessed by point spread function analysis. Results Single-shot spiral imaging is achieved at a nominal resolution of 0.8 mm, using spiral-out readouts of 53-ms duration. High depiction fidelity is achieved without conspicuous blurring or distortion. Effective resolutions are assessed as 0.8, 0.94, and 0.98 mm in CSF, gray matter and white matter, respectively. High image quality is also achieved with half-shot acquisition yielding image pairs at 1.5-mm resolution. Conclusion Use of an expanded signal model enables single-shot spiral imaging at 7 T with unprecedented image quality. Single-shot and half-shot spiral readouts deploy the sensitivity benefit of high field for rapid high-resolution imaging, particularly for functional MRI and arterial spin labeling.},

  abstract = {Diffusion microstructural imaging techniques have attracted great interest in the last decade due to their ability to quantify axon diameter and volume fraction in healthy and diseased human white matter. The estimates of compartment size and volume fraction continue to be debated, in part due to the lack of a gold standard for validation and quality control. In this work, we validate diffusion MRI estimates of compartment size and volume fraction using a novel textile axon (``taxon'') phantom constructed from hollow polypropylene yarns with distinct intra- and extra-taxonal compartments to mimic white matter in the brain. We acquired a comprehensive set of diffusion MRI measurements in the phantom using multiple gradient directions, diffusion times and gradient strengths on a human MRI scanner equipped with maximum gradient strength (Gmax) of 300\,mT/m. We obtained estimates of compartment size and restricted volume fraction through a straightforward extension of the AxCaliber/ActiveAx frameworks that enables estimation of mean compartment size in fiber bundles of arbitrary orientation. The voxel-wise taxon diameter estimates of 12.2\,{\textpm}\,0.9\,{$\mu$}m were close to the manufactured inner diameter of 11.8\,{\textpm}\,1.2\,{$\mu$}m with Gmax\,=\,300\,mT/m. The estimated restricted volume fraction demonstrated an expected decrease along the length of the fiber bundles in accordance with the known construction of the phantom. When Gmax was restricted to 80\,mT/m, the taxon diameter was overestimated, and the estimates for taxon diameter and packing density showed greater uncertainty compared to data with Gmax\,=\,300\,mT/m. In conclusion, the compartment size and volume fraction estimates resulting from diffusion measurements on a human scanner were validated against ground truth in a phantom mimicking human white matter, providing confidence that this method can yield accurate estimates of parameters in simplified but realistic microstructural environments. Our work also demonstrates the importance of a biologically analogous phantom that can be applied to validate a variety of diffusion microstructural imaging methods in human scanners and be used for standardization of diffusion MRI protocols for neuroimaging research.},

  abstract = {Biophysical models are a promising means for interpreting diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) data, as they can provide estimates of physiologically relevant parameters of microstructure including cell size, volume fraction, or dispersion. However, their application in cardiac microstructure mapping (CMM) has been limited. This study proposes seven new two-compartment models with combination of restricted cylinder models and a diffusion tensor to represent intra-and extracellular spaces, respectively. Three extended versions of the cylinder model are studied here: cylinder with elliptical cross section (ECS), cylinder with Gamma distributed radii (GDR), and cylinder with Bingham distributed axes (BDA). The proposed models were applied to data in two fixed mouse hearts, acquired with multiple diffusion times, q-shells and diffusion encoding directions. The cylinderGDR-pancake model provided the best performance in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) reducing it by 25\% compared to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The cylinderBDA-pancake model represented anatomical findings closest as it also allows for modelling dispersion. High-resolution 3D synchrotron X-ray imaging (SRI) data from the same specimen was utilized to evaluate the biophysical models. A novel tensor-based registration method is proposed to align SRI structure tensors to the MR diffusion tensors. The consistency between SRI and DW-MRI parameters demonstrates the potential of compartment models in assessing physiologically relevant parameters.},

In this paper, we propose an improved version of CS-based method for inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging. Different from the traditional l1 norm based CS ISAR imaging method, our method explores the use of Gini index to measure the sparsity of ISAR images to improve the imaging quality. Instead of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), we use weighted l1 norm as the surrogate functional and successfully develop an iteratively re-weighted algorithm to reconstruct ISAR images from compressed echo samples. Experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces the number of measurements needed for exact reconstruction and effectively suppresses the noise. Both the peak sidelobe ratio (PSLR) and the reconstruction relative error (RE) indicate that the proposed method outperforms the l1 norm based method.},

However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods. The min-max criterion is also useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as the Kaiser-Bessel function.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility to quantify blood velocities within the magnetic resonance fingerprinting framework, while providing relaxometric maps of static tissue. METHODS: Bipolar gradients are inserted into an SSFP-based MRF sequence to achieve velocity-dependent signal phases, allowing tri-directional time-resolved velocity component quantification. The accuracy of both relaxometric mapping and velocity quantification was validated in vivo and in phantom studies. RESULTS: Simulations determined that even for strong cardiac cycle length variations (700-1400 ms) Flow-MRF determines accurate velocity maps deviating {$<$}0.1\% from the ground truth on average. The cardiac cycle length variability only results in reduced velocity-to-noise ratios. Good agreement in the velocity quantification between a standard phase-contrast cine and the Flow-MRF sequence was reached in phantom experiments. Relaxometric phantom experiments determined mean deviations between Flow-MRF and spin-echo-based reference measurements of 89 {\textpm} 25 ms / 0.8 {\textpm} 2.5 ms over the range of 630-2630 ms / 49-145 ms for T1 / T2 , respectively. The in vivo study of a human knee determined mean T1 / T2 values of 1383 {\textpm} 75 ms / 26 {\textpm} 4 ms for the gastrocnemius muscle that agree with literature values. CONCLUSION: Flow-MRF presents a novel way of quantifying velocities while simultaneously providing relaxometric maps of static tissue and it can potentially be a viable method to accelerate the inherently long acquisition times of time-resolved velocity quantification.},

Simulation of MR spin flow motion is of high interest in the study of flow artifacts and angiography. However, at present, only a few simulators include this option and most are restricted to static tissue imaging. Theory and methods An extension of JEMRIS, one of the most advanced high performance open-source simulation platforms to date, was developed. The implementation of a Lagrangian description of the flow allows simulating any MR experiment, including both static tissues and complex flow data from computational fluid dynamics. Simulations of simple flow models are compared with real experiments on a physical flow phantom. A realistic simulation of 3D flow MRI on the cerebral venous network is also carried out. Results Simulations and real experiments are in good agreement. The generality of the framework is illustrated in 2D and 3D with some common flow artifacts (misregistration and inflow enhancement) and with the three main angiographic techniques: phase contrast velocimetry (PC), time-of-flight, and contrast-enhanced imaging MRA. Conclusion The framework provides a versatile and reusable tool for the simulation of any MRI experiment including physiological fluids and arbitrarily complex flow motion.},

  abstract = {The application of cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) for the assessment of thoracic aortic disease is often associated with prolonged and unpredictable acquisition times and residual motion artefacts. To overcome these limitations, we have integrated undersampled acquisition with image-based navigators and inline non-rigid motion correction to enable a free-breathing, contrast-free Cartesian CMRA framework for the visualization of the thoracic aorta in a short and predictable scan of 3 min. 35 patients with thoracic aortic disease (36 {\textpm} 13y, 14 female) were prospectively enrolled in this single-center study. The proposed 3D T2-prepared balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) sequence with image-based navigator (iNAV) was compared to the clinical 3D T2-prepared bSSFP with diaphragmatic-navigator gating (dNAV), in terms of image acquisition time. Three cardiologists blinded to iNAV vs. dNAV acquisition, recorded image quality scores across four aortic segments and their overall diagnostic confidence. Contrast ratio (CR) and relative standard deviation (RSD) of signal intensity (SI) in the corresponding segments were estimated. Co-axial aortic dimensions in six landmarks were measured by two readers to evaluate the agreement between the two methods, along with inter-observer and intra-observer agreement. Kolmogorov--Smirnov test, Mann--Whitney U (MWU), Bland--Altman analysis (BAA), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used for statistical analysis. The scan time for the iNAV-based approach was significantly shorter (3.1 {\textpm} 0.5 min vs. 12.0 {\textpm} 3.0 min for dNAV, P = 0.005). Reconstruction was performed inline in 3.0 {\textpm} 0.3 min. Diagnostic confidence was similar for the proposed iNAV versus dNAV for all three reviewers (Reviewer 1: 3.9 {\textpm} 0.3 vs. 3.8 {\textpm} 0.4, P = 0.7; Reviewer 2: 4.0 {\textpm} 0.2 vs. 3.9 {\textpm} 0.3, P = 0.4; Reviewer 3: 3.8 {\textpm} 0.4 vs. 3.7 {\textpm} 0.6, P = 0.3). The proposed method yielded higher image quality scores in terms of artefacts from respiratory motion, and non-diagnostic images due to signal inhomogeneity were observed less frequently. While the dNAV approach outperformed the iNAV method in the CR assessment, the iNAV sequence showed improved signal homogeneity along the entire thoracic aorta [RSD SI 5.1 (4.4, 6.5) vs. 6.5 (4.6, 8.6), P = 0.002]. BAA showed a mean difference of {$<$} 0.05 cm across the 6 landmarks between the two datasets. ICC showed excellent inter- and intra-observer reproducibility. Thoracic aortic iNAV-based CMRA with fast acquisition ({\textasciitilde} 3 min) and inline reconstruction (3 min) is proposed, resulting in high diagnostic confidence and reproducible aortic measurements.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether unenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography performed with a three-dimensional (3D) segmented steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence would be an alternative to contrast material-enhanced MR angiography for evaluating pulmonary veins (PVs) prior to and following radiofrequency (RF) ablation for atrial fibrillation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR angiographic examinations of PVs, performed in 20 patients (nine men, 11 women; mean age, 56.4 years +/- 12.7 [standard deviation]), were retrospectively reviewed according to an institutional review board-approved protocol. The number of PVs and their orthogonal measurements obtained from the 3D SSFP images were compared with those obtained from contrast-enhanced MR angiography. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were also compared. Qualitative assessment of both techniques was performed by independent reviewers who scored the image quality (on a scale of 1 to 5) on the basis of PV conspicuity. The presence of cardiac and extracardiac pathologic indicators was also determined. Bland-Altman and Wilcoxon signed rank statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: The mean difference in PV diameter measurements between contrast-enhanced MR angiography and 3D SSFP was -0.02 cm +/- 0.25. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were higher for 3D SSFP images than for contrast-enhanced MR angiograms. Qualitatively, there was no significant difference in PV conspicuity between the techniques. Noncardiac pathologic indicators were detected in 10 of 20 patients on 3D SSFP images but not on contrast-enhanced MR angiograms. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced PV MR angiography performed by using a free-breathing 3D SSFP technique is as accurate as contrast-enhanced MR angiography for measuring PV diameter. This technique can be used for patients in whom contrast-enhanced computed tomographic or MR angiography is contraindicated and may be sufficient in all patients.},

In patients with difficult IV access or renal insufficiency, or in those who are pregnant, we hypothesized than an unenhanced 3D segmented steady-state free precession (SSFP) MR angiography (MRA) technique would be an alternative to contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) for the evaluation of vasculature. MATERIALS AND METHODS. MRA examinations of the thoracic aorta were retrospectively reviewed in 23 patients in whom both CE-MRA and 3D SSFP were performed. CE-MRA was performed using an ECG-gated gradient-echo FLASH sequence. Three-dimensional SSFP MRA was performed during free breathing using a motion-adaptive navigator technique. Quantitative assessment of the 3D SSFP and CE-MRA image sets was performed by comparing the aortic lumen diameter. The quality of the images of the aortic root (scale of 1--5) and the presence of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular pathology were independently determined for both techniques by two reviewers. Bland-Altman and Wilcoxon's signed-rank analyses were performed. RESULTS. The difference in orthogonal measurements of the aortic diameter between those made on images from the 3D SSFP and those made from the CE-MRA sequences was --0.042 cm. The aortic root was better visualized with 3D SSFP: score of 3.78 (of 5) for CE-MRA versus score of 4.65 (of 5) for 3D SSFP (p {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION. In patients in whom contrast material is contraindicated, unenhanced MRA using a 3D SSFP technique can be performed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Spatial encoding in MRI is conventionally achieved by the application of switchable linear encoding fields. The general concept of the recently introduced PatLoc (Parallel Imaging Technique using Localized Gradients) encoding is to use nonlinear fields to achieve spatial encoding. Relaxing the requirement that the encoding fields must be linear may lead to improved gradient performance or reduced peripheral nerve stimulation. In this work, a custom-built insert coil capable of generating two independent quadratic encoding fields was driven with high-performance amplifiers within a clinical MR system. In combination with the three linear encoding fields, the combined hardware is capable of independently manipulating five spatial encoding fields. With the linear z-gradient used for slice-selection, there remain four separate channels to encode a 2D-image. To compare trajectories of such multidimensional encoding, the concept of a local k-space is developed. Through simulations, reconstructions using six gradient-encoding strategies were compared, including Cartesian encoding separately or simultaneously on both PatLoc and linear gradients as well as two versions of a radial-based in/out trajectory. Corresponding experiments confirmed that such multidimensional encoding is practically achievable and demonstrated that the new radial-based trajectory offers the PatLoc property of variable spatial resolution while maintaining finite resolution across the entire field-of-view.

  abstract = {Introduction MRI has been increasingly used in radiation therapy to facilitate tumor and organ delineation and assess treatment response. Diffusion MRI can provide cellularity information and may enable functional-based treatment planning and adaptation. However, strong distortion associated with the conventional diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging (DW-ssEPI) sequence is problematic for accurate target delineation. The goal of this work is to propose a 3D diffusion sequence with minimal distortion for radiation therapy applications. Methods A 3D diffusion-prepared magnitude-stabilized balanced steady-state free precession sequence (DP-MS-bSSFP) was developed. A 2D navigator was acquired during the linear catalyzation stage of the bSSFP readout to estimate the phase, which was then used in a plane-by-plane low-rank constrained reconstruction to correct the shot-to-shot k-space inconsistency. A diffusion phantom was scanned to evaluate and compare the geometric reliability and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) accuracy with the conventional DW-ssEPI. Eight landmarks were selected on each slice of the images to calculate the target registration error (TRE), which was used as a surrogate for geometric fidelity. The phantom was scanned under both 0{\textcelsius} and room temperature. Brain scans were performed on five healthy volunteers. In the first volunteer, protocols of 1, 2, and 4 shots per Kz plane were compared. In vivo geometric fidelity and ADC accuracy were evaluated on the remaining four volunteers using the protocol of four shots per Kz plane. In the geometric fidelity study, 8--10 landmarks were picked on each slice to calculate the TRE. Regions of interest were placed on the white matter, the cerebellum, and the cerebrospinal fluid region to evaluate the ADC agreement between DW-ssEPI and DP-MS using the Bland-Altman plot. All scans were performed at 1.5 mm isotropic resolution to meet the high-resolution requirement of many radiotherapy applications. Results The DP-MS had drastically improved geometric accuracy compared with DW-ssEPI on the phantom. The mean TRE decreased from 2.09 mm to 0.70 mm. The percentage difference of the ADC values between the two diffusion sequences were less than 5.5\% and 7\% for the 0{\textcelsius} and room temperature study, respectively. The DW-ssEPI had strong distortion and susceptibility-related artifacts at tissue air boundary, whereas distortion was minimal in DP-MS images. Overall, the mean/max TRE was over 2 mm/7 mm in the volunteers for DW-ssEPI, whereas less than 0.8 mm/2 mm for DP-MS. Good ADC agreement was observed for the white matter, the cerebellum, and the CSF based on the Bland-Altman plots. Conclusion A 3D diffusion sequence was developed and validated. It provided high-resolution diffusion imaging with mean distortion less than 1 mm at 1.5 T, and is a promising imaging technique for treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {Radiotherapy is an effective tool to treat tumors by delivering high-energy photons or charged particles to destroy malignant cancer cells. In the current fractionated radiotherapy treatment workflow, the same radiation plan is delivered to the patient in every fraction during the entire course of treatment, whereas tumor changes and patient response are not taken into consideration. Early patient response prediction is appealing as it offers a window of personalized treatment adaptation for potentially improved treatment outcome. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to be a promising non-invasive biomarker for treatment response assessment. However, the conventional diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar-imaging (DW-ssEPI) has strong spatial distortion, which is unacceptable for radiotherapy applications as high geometric accuracy is required for accurate tumor delineation. To achieve the ultimate goal of response-based adaptive radiotherapy, this dissertation sought to develop distortion-free diffusion sequences, and evaluate the possibility of early treatment response assessment using longitudinal DWI on sarcoma patient. In Chapter 3, a diffusion-prepared turbo spin-echo (DP-TSE) sequence was programmed and compared with the DW-ssEPI sequence on a 0.35T MRI-guided radiotherapy system. The DW-ssEPI failed the spatial integrity test due to severe distortion and low signal intensity, whereas the DP-TSE passed the test successfully. The diffusion phantom study showed that noise correction must be performed for the DW-ssEPI sequence to avoid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) quantification errors, whereas DP-TSE had desirable ADC accuracy and ADC reproducibility. Good geometric fidelity and ADC quantifications were obtained in the patient study involving two glioblastoma (GBM) patients and six sarcoma patients. Shot-to-shot k-space magnitude inconsistency is a common problem in multi-shot diffusion-prepared imaging. In Chapter 4, a magnitude stabilizer strategy was proposed to convert the malignant magnitude inconsistency to phase inconsistency, which is easier to resolve. We demonstrated that the proposed diffusion-prepared magnitude-stabilized balanced steady-state free precession sequence (DP-MS-bSSFP, abbreviated as DP-MS) had satisfactory ADC accuracy, and significantly improved geometric accuracy on both phantom and volunteers compared to the conventional DW-ssEPI approach. To meet the requirement of high spatial integrity and high spatial resolution for treatment planning and adaptation, the 2D DP-MS sequence was extended to 3D in Chapter 5. A locally low-rank constrained reconstruction was applied to correct the k-space inconsistency. Similar as Chapter 4, the 3D DP-MS sequence was verified on the diffusion phantom and five healthy volunteers for geometric fidelity and ADC accuracy. Overall, the 3D DP-MS sequence had submillimeter geometric accuracy and satisfactory ADC accuracy on both phantom and volunteers. In the second half of this dissertation, we focused on early treatment response prediction using longitudinal DWI on sarcoma patients treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy. Diffusion images were acquired using DW-ssEPI three times through the treatment. In Chapter 6, a radiomics-based approach was used to prediction treatment effect score, which is obtained from the post-surgery pathology. Logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models were constructed to predict the treatment effect using radiomics features selected by univariate analysis and sequential forward selection. The SVM model outperformed logistic regression and had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91{\dbend}0.05. To overcome the small sample size problem in Chapter 6 and further improve the prediction, deep learning-based data augmentation and prediction were implemented in Chapter 7. An ACGAN network was trained to augment the data based on training patients, and a prediction model based on the VGG-19 was trained using the synthesized data and validated on the training patient dataset. This trained model was then tested on the hold-out test patients. Overall, the training, validation, and test accuracies was 94.3\%, 90.1\%, and 87.7\%, indicating good performance of the data augmentation and response prediction models.},

Methods A signal spoiler (magnitude stabilizer; MS) was implemented in a DP-bSSFP diffusion sequence. Effects of magnitude stabilizers with respect to phase errors were simulated using Bloch simulation. Phantom study was conducted to compare the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) accuracy and geometric reliability, quantified using target registration error (TRE), with diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging (DW-ssEPI). Six volunteers were recruited. DW-ssEPI, DP-bSSFP with and without ECG triggering, and DP-MS-bSSFP with and without ECG triggering were acquired 10 times with b = 500 s/mm2 in a single-shot manner to evaluate magnitude variability. Diffusion trace images and diffusion tensor images were acquired using a 4-shot DP-MS-bSSFP. Results Simulation showed that the DP-MS-bSSFP approach is insensitive to phase errors. The DP-MS-bSSFP approach had satisfactory ADC accuracy on the phantom with {$<$}5\% difference with DW-ssEPI. The mean/max TRE for DW-ssEPI was 2.31/4.29 mm and was 0.51/1.20 mm for DP-MS-bSSFP. In the repeated single-shot study, DP-bSSFP without ECG triggering had severe signal void artifacts and exhibited a nonrepeatable pattern, which can be partially mitigated by ECG triggering. Adding the MS provided stable signal magnitude across all repetitions. High-quality ADC maps and color-coded fractional anisotropy maps were generated using the 4-shot DP-MS-bSSFP. The mean/max TRE was 2.89/10.80 mm for DW-ssEPI and 0.59/1.69 mm for DP-MS-bSSFP. Good agreements of white matter ADC, cerebrospinal fluid ADC, and white matter fractional anisotropy value were observed between DP-MS-bSSFP and DW-ssEPI.

It occurs before the establishment of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) but its early origins and evolution around the time of birth are unknown. Our aim is to investigate whether myoarchitectural abnormalities in HCM are present in the fetal heart. We used wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous hearts (n = 56) from a Mybpc3-targeted knock-out HCM mouse model and imaged the 3D micro-structure by high-resolution episcopic microscopy. We developed a novel structure tensor approach to extract, display and quantify myocyte orientation and its local angular uniformity by helical angle, angle of intrusion and myoarchitectural disarray index, respectively, immediately before and after birth. In wild-type, we demonstrate uniformity of orientation of cardiomyocytes with smooth transitions of helical angle transmurally both before and after birth but with traces of disarray at the septal insertion points of the right ventricle. In comparison, heterozygous mice free of LVH, and homozygous mice showed not only loss of the normal linear helical angulation transmural profiles observed in wild-type but also fewer circumferentially arranged myocytes at birth. Heterozygous and homozygous showed more disarray with a wider distribution than in wild-type before birth. In heterozygous mice, disarray was seen in the anterior, septal and inferior walls irrespective of stage, whereas in homozygous mice it extended to the whole LV circumference including the lateral wall. In conclusion, myoarchitectural disarray is detectable in the fetal heart of an HCM mouse model before the development of LVH.},

  abstract = {Myocardial infarction leads to complex changes in the fiber architecture of the heart. Here, we present a novel optical approach to characterize these changes in intact hearts in three dimensions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to derive a depth-resolved field of orientation on which tractography was performed. Tractography of healthy myocardium revealed a smooth linear transition in fiber inclination or helix angle from the epicardium to endocardium. Conversely, in infarcted hearts, no coherent microstructure could be identified in the infarct with OCT. Additional characterization of the infarct was performed by the measurement of light attenuation and with two-photon microscopy. Myofibers were imaged using autofluorescence and collagen fibers using second harmonic generation. This revealed the presence of two distinct microstructural patterns in areas of the infarct with high light attenuation. In the presence of residual myofibers, the surrounding collagen fibers were aligned in a coherent manner parallel to the myofibers. In the absence of residual myofibers, the collagen fibers were randomly oriented and lacked any microstructural coherence. The presence of residual myofibers thus exerts a profound effect on the microstructural properties of the infarct scar and consequently the risk of aneurysm formation and arrhythmias. Catheter-based approaches to segment and image myocardial microstructure in humans are feasible and could play a valuable role in guiding the development of strategies to improve infarct healing.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved into an outstandingly versatile diagnostic modality, as it has the ability to non-invasively produce detailed information on a tissue's structure and function. Complementary data is normally obtained in separate measurements, either as contrast-weighted images, which are fast and simple to acquire, or as quantitative parametric maps, which offer an absolute quantification of underlying biophysical effects, such as relaxation times or flow. Here, we demonstrate how to acquire and reconstruct data in a transient-state with a dual purpose: 1 -- to generate contrast-weighted images that can be adjusted to emphasise clinically relevant image biomarkers; exemplified with signal modulation according to flow to obtain angiography information, and 2 -- to simultaneously infer multiple quantitative parameters with a single, highly accelerated acquisition. This is achieved by introducing three novel elements: a model that accounts for flowing blood, a method for sequence design using smooth flip angle excitation patterns that incorporates both parameter encoding and signal contrast, and the reconstruction of temporally resolved contrast-weighted images. From these images we simultaneously obtain angiography projections and multiple quantitative maps. By doing so, we increase the amount of clinically relevant data without adding measurement time, creating new dimensions for biomarker exploration and adding value to MR examinations for patients and clinicians alike.},

Theory and Methods A new exact solution per time step is derived by means of eigenvalues and generalized eigenvectors. Fast numerical solution methods based on asymmetric and symmetric operator splitting, which are already known for the Bloch equations, are extended to the Bloch-McConnell equations. Those methods are compared to other numerical methods including spin domain, one-step and multi-step methods, and matrix exponential. Error metrics are introduced based on the exact solution method, which allows to assess the accuracy of each solution method quantitatively for arbitrary example data. Results Accuracy and performance properties for nine different solution methods are analyzed and compared in extensive numerical experiments including various examples for non-selective and slice-selective MR imaging applications. The accuracy of the methods heavily varies, in particular for short relaxation times and long pulse durations. Conclusion In absence of relaxation effects, the numerical results confirm the rotation matrices approach as accurate and computationally efficient Bloch solution method. Otherwise, as well as for the Bloch-McConnell equations, symmetric operator splitting methods are recommended due to their excellent numerical accuracy paired with efficient run time.},

  abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate a simulation framework that enables the direct and quantitative comparison of post-processing methods for diffusion weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) images. DW-MR datasets are employed in a range of techniques that enable estimates of local microstructure and global connectivity in the brain. These techniques require full alignment of images across the dataset, but this is rarely the case. Artefacts such as eddy-current (EC) distortion and motion lead to misalignment between images, which compromise the quality of the microstructural measures obtained from them. Numerous methods and software packages exist to correct these artefacts, some of which have become de-facto standards, but none have been subject to rigorous validation. In the literature, improved alignment is assessed using either qualitative visual measures or quantitative surrogate metrics. Here we introduce a simulation framework that allows for the direct, quantitative assessment of techniques, enabling objective comparisons of existing and future methods. DW-MR datasets are generated using a process that is based on the physics of MRI acquisition, which allows for the salient features of the images and their artefacts to be reproduced. We apply this framework in three ways. Firstly we assess the most commonly used method for artefact correction, FSL's eddy\_correct, and compare it to a recently proposed alternative, eddy. We demonstrate quantitatively that using eddy\_correct leads to significant errors in the corrected data, whilst eddy is able to provide much improved correction. Secondly we investigate the datasets required to achieve good correction with eddy, by looking at the minimum number of directions required and comparing the recommended full-sphere acquisitions to equivalent half-sphere protocols. Finally, we investigate the impact of correction quality by examining the fits from microstructure models to real and simulated data.},

  abstract = {Background Myocardial native T1 and T2~mapping are promising techniques for quantitative assessment of diffuse myocardial pathologies; however, due to conflicting data regarding normal values, routine clinical implementation of this method is still challenging. Methods To evaluate this situation during daily clinical practice the characteristics of normal values obtained in 60 healthy volunteers who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on~1.5T and 3T scanners were studied. The T1 modified look-locker inversion recovery (MOLLI; 5(3)3; modified for higher heart rates) and T2~navigator gated black-blood prepared gradient-spin-echo (GraSE) sequences were used. Results While age and body mass index did not affect relaxation times, a~gender and heart rate dependency was found showing higher T1 and T2~values in females, whereas at higher heart rates a~prolongation of T1 and a~shortening of T2~relaxation times was found. Particularly prone to artifacts were T2~measurements at 3T and the inferolateral wall. In the individual setting mean relaxation times for T1 were 995.8\,{\textpm}\,30.9\,ms at 1.5T and 1183.8\,{\textpm}\,37.5\,ms at 3T and 55.8\,{\textpm}\,2.8\,ms at 1.5T and 51.6\,{\textpm}\,3\,ms at 3T for T2 indicating a~high dependency of reference values on MRI protocol when compared to the literature. Furthermore, as presumed mean T1 and T2~values correlated in the same individual. Conclusions The T1 and T2~relaxation times depend on physiological factors and especially on MRI protocols. Therefore, reference values should be validated individually in every radiological institution before implementing mapping protocols in daily clinical practice. Correlation of mean T1 and T2~values in the same proband at both field strengths indicates intraindividual reproducibility.},

Images were acquired through use of a spin-echo technique. They were of doped water passing through a glass U-tube, simulating a small vein, which fitted into the magnetic field gradient and radiofrequency coils of an NMR imaging apparatus. For the case of the inlet arm of the U-tube, the flow images displayed an intensity distribution which compared favorably to a simple physical model based on laminar flow. The intensity distribution observed for the outlet arm was explained through consideration of the perturbation to flow introduced by the U-bend. Generally, the results of the feasibility study indicate that (a) the NMR spin-echo image is modified by flow in a predictable manner, (b) display of the velocity profile is possible, (c) through use of a U-tube some separation can be demonstrated within a single image of the twin factors, proton incursion into the image "slice" and proton dephasing, which generally combine to modify the flow image intensity, and (d) discrimination between different modes of flow may be possible by NMR CT. The clinical potential suggested by the results is discussed; NMR rheotomography may prove to be particularly useful for the noninvasive diagnosis of structurally-originating cardiovascular defects.},

  abstract = {A geometrical confinement considerably affects the diffusive motion of the nuclei and the consequent signal attenuation under inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In this article, we illustrate the use of Laplacian eigenfunctions to describe this effect. Starting from the classical Bloch-Torrey equation, we obtain the free induction decay (FID) and the spin-echo or gradient-echo signal in a compact matrix form. Each attenuation mechanism (restricted diffusion, gradient dephasing, surface or bulk relaxation) is represented by a matrix which is constructed from the Laplace operator eigenbasis and thus depending only on the geometry of the confinement. In turn, the physical parameters (free diffusion coefficient, gradient intensity, surface or bulk relaxivity) characterize the ``strengths'' of the underlying attenuation mechanisms and naturally appear as coefficients in front of these matrices. Once the Laplacian eigenfunctions for a given confinement are found (analytically or numerically), further computation of the macroscopic signal is more accurate and much faster than by using conventional simulation methods. The matrix technique is actually a simple numerical tool to deal with arbitrary gradient waveforms, including simple or stimulated, single or multiple spin echoes. We illustrate its efficiency by considering restricted diffusion in simple domains: a slab, a cylinder, and a sphere. In a companion paper, we shall focus on theoretical advances achieved by using Laplacian eigenfunctions. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part A 32A: 277--301, 2008.},

  abstract = {Quantitative MRI methods and learning-based algorithms require exact forward simulations. One critical factor to correctly describe magnetization dynamics is the effect of slice-selective RF pulses. While contemporary simulation techniques correctly capture their influence, they only provide final magnetization distributions, require to be run for each parameter set separately, and make it hard to derive general theoretical conclusions and to generate a fundamental understanding of echo formation in the presence of slice-profile effects. This work aims to provide a mathematically exact framework, which is equally intuitive as extended phase graphs (EPGs), but also considers slice-profiles through their natural spatial representation. We show, through an analytical, hybrid Bloch-EPG formalism, that the spatially-resolved EPG approach allows to exactly predict the signal dependency on off-resonance, spoiling moment, microscopic dephasing, and echo time. We also demonstrate that our formalism allows to use the same phase graph to simulate both gradient-spoiled and balanced SSFP-based MR sequences. We present a derivation of the formalism and identify the connection to existing methods, i.e. slice-selective Bloch, slice-selective EPG, and the partitioned EPG. As a use case, the proposed hybrid Bloch-EPG framework is applied to MR Fingerprinting.},

A section-selective gradient refocusing pulse sequence with a short repetition time caused flow-related enhancement from spins that flowed perpendicular to the transaxial sections. The signal was further enhanced by means of flow compensation gradients to rephase any phase shifts resulting from moving spins in the presence of the imaging gradients. Coronal and sagittal sections, reformatted from multiple transaxial sections, are shown to have excellent vessel contrast without the use of contrast material. These images were obtained in 12 minutes of acquisition time from as many as 60 sections of 3-mm thickness. Such a technique shows significant promise for MR angiography.},

Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) is the reference standard for non-invasive imaging of myocardial scar and focal fibrosis and is valuable in the differential diagnosis of ischaemic versus non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Diffuse fibrosis may go undetected on LGE imaging. Tissue characterisation with parametric mapping methods has the potential to detect and quantify both focal and diffuse alterations in myocardial structure not assessable by LGE. Native and post-contrast T1 mapping in particular has shown promise as a novel biomarker to support diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic decision making in ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies as well as in patients with acute chest pain syndromes. Furthermore, changes in the myocardium over time may be assessed longitudinally with this non-invasive tissue characterisation method.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) accounting for the majority of cases. X-ray coronary angiography and computed tomography coronary angiography (CCTA) are the imaging modalities of choice for the assessment of CAD. However, the use of ionising radiation and iodinated contrast agents remain drawbacks. There is therefore a clinical need for an alternative modality for the early identification and longitudinal monitoring of CAD without these associated drawbacks. Coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) could be a potential alternative for the detection and monitoring of coronary arterial stenosis, without exposing patients to ionising radiation or iodinated contrast agents. Further advantages include its versatility, excellent soft tissue characterisation and suitability for repeat imaging. Despite the early promise of CMRA, widespread clinical utilisation remains limited due to long and unpredictable scan times, onerous scan planning, lower spatial resolution, as well as motion related image quality degradation. The past decade has brought about a resurgence in CMRA technology, with significant leaps in image acceleration, respiratory and cardiac motion estimation and advanced motion corrected or motion-resolved image reconstruction. With the advent of artificial intelligence, great advances are also seen in deep learning-based motion estimation, undersampled and super-resolution reconstruction promising further improvements of CMRA. This has enabled high spatial resolution (1 mm isotropic), 3D whole heart CMRA in a clinically feasible and reliable acquisition time of under 10 min. Furthermore, latest super-resolution image reconstruction approaches which are currently under evaluation promise acquisitions as short as 1 min. In this review, we will explore the recent technological advances that are designed to bring CMRA closer to clinical reality.},

  abstract = {Deformation and wall-thickening of ventricular myocardium are essential for cardiac pump function. However, insight into the histo-anatomical basis for cardiac tissue re-arrangement during contraction is limited. In this report, we describe dynamic changes in regionally prevailing cardiomyocyte (fibre) and myolaminar (sheet) orientations, using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) of ventricles in the same living heart in two different mechanical states. Hearts, isolated from Sprague--Dawley rats, were Langendorff-perfused and imaged, initially in their slack state during cardioplegic arrest, then during lithium-induced contracture. Regional fibre- and sheet-orientations were derived from DTI-data on a voxel-wise basis. Contraction was accompanied with a decrease in left-handed helical fibres (handedness relative to the baso-apical direction) in basal, equatorial, and apical sub-epicardium (by 14.0\%, 17.3\%, 15.8\% respectively; p~{$<~$}0.001), and an increase in right-handed helical fibres of the sub-endocardium (by 11.0\%, 12.1\% and 16.1\%, respectively; p~{$<~$}0.001). Two predominant sheet-populations were observed, with sheet-angles of either positive ({$\beta$}+) or negative ({$\beta-$}) polarity relative to a `chamber-horizontal plane' (defined as normal to the left ventricular long-axis). In contracture, mean `intersection'-angle (geometrically quantifiable intersection of sheet-angle projections) between {$\beta$}+ and {$\beta-$} sheet-populations increased from 86.2~{\textpm}~5.5{$^\circ$} (slack) to 108.3~{\textpm}~5.4{$^\circ$} (p~{$<~$}0.001). Subsequent high-resolution DTI of fixed myocardium, and histological sectioning, reconfirmed the existence of alternating sheet-plane populations. Our results suggest that myocardial tissue layers in alternating sheet-populations align into a more chamber-horizontal orientation during contraction. This re-arrangement occurs via an accordion-like mechanism that, combined with inter-sheet slippage, can significantly contribute to ventricular deformation, including wall-thickening in a predominantly centripetal direction and baso-apical shortening.},

  abstract = {The Bloch equation describes the evolution of classical particles tagged with a magnetisation vector in a strong magnetic field and is fundamental to many NMR and MRI contrast methods. The equation can be generalised to include the effects of spin motion by including a spin flux, which typically contains a Fickian diffusive term and/or a coherent velocity term. This form is known as the Bloch-Torrey equation, and is fundamental to MR modalities which are sensitive to spin dynamics such as diffusion MRI. Such modalities have received a great deal of interest in the research literature over the last few years, resulting in a huge range of models and methods.   In this work we make make use of a more general Bloch-Torrey equation with a generalised flux term. We show that many commonly employed approaches in Diffusion MRI may be viewed as different choices for the flux terms in this equation. This viewpoint, although obvious theoretically, is not usually emphasised in the diffusion MR literature and points to interesting new directions for methods development.   In the interests of completeness, we describe all the necessary mathematical and physical framework -- including the method used to solve the various Bloch-Torrey equations. We then review the relevant portions of the diffusion MRI literature and show how different flux choices lead to different models. All the models considered here are continuum-based but we also discuss their relationship to so-called microstructure methods and other more advanced ideas such as time-dependent diffusivities.},

Similar systems in the literature consider only simple substrates and their authors do not consider convergence and parameter optimization. We show how to run Monte-Carlo simulations within complex irregular substrates. We compare the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation to an analytical model of restricted diffusion to assess precision and accuracy of the generated results. We obtain an optimal combination of spins and updates for a given run time by trading off number of updates in favor of number of spins such that precision and accuracy of sythesized data are both optimized. Further experiments demonstrate the system using a tissue environment that current analytic models cannot capture. This tissue model incorporates swelling, abutting, and deformation. Swelling-induced restriction in the extracellular space due to the effects of abutting cylinders leads to large departures from the predictions of the analytical model, which does not capture these effects. This swelling-induced restriction may be an important mechanism in explaining the changes in apparent diffusion constant observed in the aftermath of acute ischemic stroke.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce a two-dimensional MR fingerprinting (MRF) technique for quantification of T1 , T2 , and M0 in myocardium. METHODS: An electrocardiograph-triggered MRF method is introduced for mapping myocardial T1 , T2 , and M0 during a single breath-hold in as short as four heartbeats. The pulse sequence uses variable flip angles, repetition times, inversion recovery times, and T2 preparation dephasing times. A dictionary of possible signal evolutions is simulated for each scan that incorporates the subject's unique variations in heart rate. Aspects of the sequence design were explored in simulations, and the accuracy and precision of cardiac MRF were assessed in a phantom study. In vivo imaging was performed at 3 Tesla in 11 volunteers to generate native parametric maps. RESULTS: T1 and T2 measurements from the proposed cardiac MRF sequence correlated well with standard spin echo measurements in the phantom study (R2 \,{$>$}\,0.99). A Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement for myocardial T1 measurements between MRF and MOLLI (bias 1 ms, 95\% limits of agreement -72 to 72 ms) and T2 measurements between MRF and T2 -prepared balanced steady-state free precession (bias, -2.6 ms; 95\% limits of agreement, -8.5 to 3.3 ms). CONCLUSION: MRF can provide quantitative single slice T1 , T2 , and M0 maps in the heart within a single breath-hold.

The developed gr-MRI software package comprises a set of Python scripts, flowgraphs, and signal generation and recording blocks for GNU Radio, an open-source SDR software package that is widely used in communications research. gr-MRI implements basic event sequencing functionality, and tools for system calibrations, multi-radio synchronization, and MR signal processing and image reconstruction. It includes four pulse sequences: a single-pulse sequence to record free induction signals, a gradient-recalled echo imaging sequence, a spin echo imaging sequence, and an inversion recovery spin echo imaging sequence. The sequences were used to perform phantom imaging scans with a 0.5Tesla tabletop MRI scanner and two commercially-available SDRs. One SDR was used for RF excitation and reception, and the other for gradient pulse generation. The total SDR hardware cost was approximately \$2000. The frequency of radio desynchronization events and the frequency with which the software recovered from those events was also measured, and the SDR's ability to generate frequency-swept RF waveforms was validated and compared to the scanner's commercial spectrometer. The spin echo images geometrically matched those acquired using the commercial spectrometer, with no unexpected distortions. Desynchronization events were more likely to occur at the very beginning of an imaging scan, but were nearly eliminated if the user invoked the sequence for a short period before beginning data recording. The SDR produced a 500kHz bandwidth frequency-swept pulse with high fidelity, while the commercial spectrometer produced a waveform with large frequency spike errors. In conclusion, the developed gr-MRI software can be used to develop high-fidelity, low-cost custom MRI spectrometers using commercially-available SDRs.},

  abstract = {Spin echoes have been known since 1950. Although their formal description by use of the Bloch equations is straightforward, it does not lead to an intuitive understanding of their behavior except for the special cases of 180{$^\circ$} or 90{$^\circ$} pulses, especially when many pulses are applied before the magnetization has returned into thermal equilibrium. The extended-phasegraph algorithm, which takes into account that the total magnetization in spin-echo sequences is a superposition of many isochromats, allows the recognition of all possible echo signals in arbitrary pulse sequences. Its application to multi-echo sequences leads to a number of surprising results. It can be demonstrated that refocusing pulses with flip angles much lower than 180{$^\circ$} generate an unexpectedly high signal intensity after a few echo periods. Apart from leading to a simple algorithm for the exact calculation of echo intensities in arbitrary multi-pulse sequences, the phase-graph algorithm leads to a simple understanding of the contrast behavior of different gradient echo sequences and gives a rational means for the design of MR-imaging sequences that are free from spurious echoes.},

In combination with parallel local receiver coils these fields allow one to overcome the current limitations of neuronal nerve stimulation. Additionally the geometry of such fields can be adapted to anatomy. Materials and methods As an example of such a parallel imaging technique using localized gradients (PatLoc)- system, we present a polar gradient system consisting of 2 {\texttimes} 8 rectangular current loops in octagonal arrangement, which generates a radial magnetic field gradient. By inverting the direction of current in alternating loops, a near sinusoidal field variation in the circumferential direction is produced. Ambiguities in spatial assignment are resolved by use of multiple receiver coils and parallel reconstruction. Simulations demonstrate the potential advantages and limitations of this approach. Results and conclusions The exact behaviour of PatLoc fields with respect to peripheral nerve stimulation needs to be tested in practice. Based on geometrical considerations SEMs of radial geometry allow for about three times faster gradient switching compared to conventional head gradient inserts and even more compared to whole body gradients. The strong nonlinear geometry of the fields needs to be considered for practical applications.},

  abstract = {Several self-navigation techniques have been proposed to improve respiratory motion compensation in coronary MR angiography. In this work, we implemented a 2D self-navigation method by using the startup profiles of a whole-heart balanced Steady-state free precession sequence, which are primarily used to catalyze the magnetization towards the steady-state. To create 2D self-navigation images (2DSN), we added phase encoding gradients to the startup profiles. With this approach we calculated foot--head and left--right motion and performed retrospective translational motion correction. The 2DSN images were reconstructed from 10 startup profiles acquired at the beginning of each shot. Nine healthy subjects were scanned, and the proposed method was compared to a 1D self-navigation (1DSN) method with foot--head correction only. Foot--head correction was also performed with the diaphragmatic 1D pencil beam navigator (1Dnav) using a tracking factor of 0.6. 2DSN shows improved motion correction compared to 1DSN and 1Dnav for all coronary arteries and all subjects for the investigated diaphragmatic gating window of 10 mm. The visualized vessel length of the right coronary artery could be significantly improved with a multiple targeted 2D self-navigation approach, compared to 2DSN method.

The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suitable for either serial or parallel machine environments. Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.},

In the years since 3.0T scanners were first approved for clinical use, one of the areas which has benefited greatly from its introduction is neurovascular MR angiography (MRA). Early experience has shown significant improvements in resolution and image quality. Whether high field strength MRA is robust or accurate enough to replace digital subtraction angiography in the foreseeable future remains to be seen. This article discusses the current state of neurovascular MRA at 3.0T, basic physical differences between MR imaging at 1.5T and 3.0T, and their effects on MRA sequences. The literature regarding the efficacy of 3.0T MRA techniques for diagnosing specific neurovascular pathologies and carotid steno occlusive disease is reviewed.},

  abstract = {The {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell \_1 norm is the tight convex relaxation for the {$\ell$}0{$\ell$}0{\textbackslash}ell \_0 norm and has been successfully applied for recovering sparse signals. However, for problems with fewer samples than required for accurate {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell \_1 recovery, one needs to apply nonconvex penalties such as {$\ell$}p{$\ell$}p{\textbackslash}ell \_p norm. As one method for solving {$\ell$}p{$\ell$}p{\textbackslash}ell \_p minimization problems, iteratively reweighted {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell \_1 minimization updates the weight for each component based on the value of the same component at the previous iteration. It assigns large weights on small components in magnitude and small weights on large components in magnitude. The set of the weights is not fixed, and it makes the analysis of this method difficult. In this paper, we consider a weighted {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell \_1 penalty with the set of the weights fixed, and the weights are assigned based on the sort of all the components in magnitude. The smallest weight is assigned to the largest component in magnitude. This new penalty is called nonconvex sorted {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell \_1. Then we propose two methods for solving nonconvex sorted {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell \_1 minimization problems: iteratively reweighted {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell \_1 minimization and iterative sorted thresholding, and prove that both methods will converge to a local minimizer of the nonconvex sorted {$\ell$}1{$\ell$}1{\textbackslash}ell \_1 minimization problems. We also show that both methods are generalizations of iterative support detection and iterative hard thresholding, respectively. The numerical experiments demonstrate the better performance of assigning weights by sort compared to assigning by value.},

Instead, HOPs enables viewers to infer properties of the distribution using mental processes like counting and integration. We conducted an experiment comparing HOPs to error bars and violin plots.

In this paper, six properties are discussed: (Robin Hood, Scaling, Rising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates, and Babies), each of which a sparsity measure should have. The main contributions of this paper are the proofs and the associated summary table which classify commonly-used sparsity measures based on whether or not they satisfy these six propositions.

We propose a fully integrated sequence simultaneously sampling the acquisition parameter spaces required for T1 and T2* relaxometry and diffusion MRI. Slice-level interleaved diffusion encoding, multiple spin/gradient echoes and slice-shuffling are combined for higher efficiency, sampling flexibility and enhanced internal consistency. In-vivo data was successfully acquired on healthy adult brains. Obtained parametric maps as well as clustering results demonstrate the potential of the technique to provide eloquent data with an acceleration of roughly 20 compared to conventionally used approaches. The proposed integrated acquisition, which we call ZEBRA, offers significant acceleration and flexibility compared to existing diffusion-relaxometry studies, and thus facilitates wider use of these techniques both for research-driven and clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading single cause of morbidity and mortality, causing over 17. 9 million deaths worldwide per year with associated costs of over \$800 billion. Improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CVD is therefore a global priority. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has emerged as a clinically important technique for the assessment of cardiovascular anatomy, function, perfusion, and viability. However, diversity and complexity of imaging, reconstruction and analysis methods pose some limitations to the widespread use of CMR. Especially in view of recent developments in the field of machine learning that provide novel solutions to address existing problems, it is necessary to bridge the gap between the clinical and scientific communities. This review covers five essential aspects of CMR to provide a comprehensive overview ranging from CVDs to CMR pulse sequence design, acquisition protocols, motion handling, image reconstruction and quantitative analysis of the obtained data. (1) The basic MR physics of CMR is introduced. Basic pulse sequence building blocks that are commonly used in CMR imaging are presented. Sequences containing these building blocks are formed for parametric mapping and functional imaging techniques. Commonly perceived artifacts and potential countermeasures are discussed for these methods. (2) CMR methods for identifying CVDs are illustrated. Basic anatomy and functional processes are described to understand the cardiac pathologies and how they can be captured by CMR imaging. (3) The planning and conduct of a complete CMR exam which is targeted for the respective pathology is shown. Building blocks are illustrated to create an efficient and patient-centered workflow. Further strategies to cope with challenging patients are discussed. (4) Imaging acceleration and reconstruction techniques are presented that enable acquisition of spatial, temporal, and parametric dynamics of the cardiac cycle. The handling of respiratory and cardiac motion strategies as well as their integration into the reconstruction processes is showcased. (5) Recent advances on deep learning-based reconstructions for this purpose are summarized. Furthermore, an overview of novel deep learning image segmentation and analysis methods is provided with a focus on automatic, fast and reliable extraction of biomarkers and parameters of clinical relevance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dixon cardiac magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been recently introduced to simultaneously provide water T1 , water T2 , and fat fraction (FF) maps. PURPOSE: To assess Dixon cardiac MRF repeatability in healthy subjects and its clinical feasibility in a cohort of patients with cardiovascular disease. POPULATION: T1MES phantom, water-fat phantom, 11 healthy subjects and 19 patients with suspected cardiovascular disease. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5T, inversion recovery spin echo (IRSE), multiecho spin echo (MESE), modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI), T2 gradient spin echo (T2 -GRASE), 6-echo gradient rewound echo (GRE), and Dixon cardiac MRF. ASSESSMENT: Dixon cardiac MRF precision was assessed through repeated scans against conventional MOLLI, T2 -GRASE, and PDFF in phantom and 11 healthy subjects. Dixon cardiac MRF native T1 , T2 , FF, postcontrast T1 and synthetic extracellular volume (ECV) maps were assessed in 19 patients in comparison to conventional sequences. Measurements in patients were performed in the septum and in late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) areas and assessed using mean value distributions, correlation, and Bland-Altman plots. Image quality and diagnostic confidence were assessed by three experts using 5-point scoring scales. STATISTICAL TESTS: Paired Wilcoxon rank signed test and paired t-tests were applied. Statistical significance was indicated by *(P\,{$<$}\,0.05). RESULTS: Dixon cardiac MRF showed good overall precision in phantom and in vivo. Septal average repeatability was {\textasciitilde}23 msec for T1 , {\textasciitilde}2.2 msec for T2 , and\,{\textasciitilde}1\% for FF. Biases in healthy subjects/patients were measured at +37 msec*/+60 msec* and -8.8 msec*/-8 msec* when compared to MOLLI and T2 -GRASE, respectively. No statistically significant differences in postcontrast T1 (P = 0.17) and synthetic ECV (P = 0.19) measurements were observed in patients. DATA CONCLUSION: Dixon cardiac MRF attained good overall precision in phantom and healthy subjects, while providing coregistered T1 , T2 , and fat fraction maps in a single breath-hold scan with similar or better image quality than conventional methods in patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2. TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study explores the possibility of using gradient echo based sequences other than bSSFP in the magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) framework to quantify the relaxation parameters. Methods An MRF method based on a fast imaging with steady state precession (FISP) sequence structure is presented. A dictionary containing possible signal evolutions with physiological range of T1 and T2 was created using the extended phase graph (EPG) formalism according to the acquisition parameters. The proposed method was evaluated in a phantom and a human brain. T1, T2 and proton density were quantified directly from the undersampled data by the pattern recognition algorithm. Results T1 and T2 values from the phantom demonstrate that the results of MRF FISP are in good agreement with the traditional gold-standard methods. T1 and T2 values in brain are within the range of previously reported values. Conclusion MRF FISP enables a fast and accurate quantification of the relaxation parameters, while is immune to the banding artifact of bSSFP due to B0 inhomogeneities, which could improve the ability to use MRF for applications beyond brain imaging.},

Due to the clear design of the software, new pulse sequences can be created, tested, and executed within a short time. To post-process the acquired data, an interface to well-known numerical libraries is part of the framework. This allows a transparent integration of the data processing instructions into the measurement module.

  abstract = {Background The purpose of this meta-analysis was to comprehensively investigate the diagnostic ability of 1.5~T and 3.0~T whole heart coronary angiography (WHCA) to detect significant coronary artery disease (CAD) on X-ray coronary angiography. Methods A literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane advanced search, and EMBASE, was performed to retrieve and integrate articles showing significant CAD detectability of 1.5 and 3.0~T WHCA. Results Data from 1899 patients from 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis. 1.5~T WHCA had a summary area under ROC of 0.88 in the patient-based analysis, 0.90 in the vessel-based analysis, and 0.92 in the segment-based analysis. These values for 3.0~T WHCA were 0.94, 0.95, 0.96, respectively. Contrast-enhanced 3.0~T WHCA had significantly higher specificity than non-contrast-enhanced 1.5~T WHCA on a patient-based analysis (0.87, 95\% CI 0.80--0.92 vs. 0.74, 95\% CI 0.64--0.82, P\,=\,0.02). There were no differences in diagnostic performance on a patient-based analysis by use of vasodilators, beta-blockers or between Asian and Western countries. Conclusions The diagnostic performance of WHCA was deemed satisfactory, with contrast-enhanced 3.0~T WHCA exhibiting higher specificity compared to non-contrast-enhanced 1.5~T WHCA in a patient-based analysis. There were no significant differences in diagnostic performance on a patient-based analysis in terms of vasodilator or beta-blocker use, nor between Asian and Western countries. However, further large-scale multicentre studies are crucial for the widespread global adoption of WHCA.

  abstract = {Late enhancement imaging is used to diagnose and characterize a wide range of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies, and its use has become ubiquitous in the cardiac MR exam. As the use of late enhancement imaging has matured and the span of applications has widened, the demands on image quality have grown. The characterization of subendocardial MI now includes the accurate quantification of scar size, shape, and characterization of borders which have been shown to have prognostic significance. More diverse patterns of late enhancement including patchy, mid-wall, subepicardial, or diffuse enhancement are of interest in diagnosing nonischemic cardiomyopathies. As clinicians are examining late enhancement images for more subtle indication of fibrosis, the demand for lower artifacts has increased. A range of new techniques have emerged to improve the speed and quality of late enhancement imaging including: methods for acquisition during free breathing, and fat water separated imaging for characterizing fibrofatty infiltration and reduction of artifacts related to the presence of fat. Methods for quantification of T1 and extracellular volume fraction are emerging to tackle the issue of discriminating globally diffuse fibrosis from normal healthy tissue which is challenging using conventional late enhancement methods. The aim of this review will be to describe the current state of the art and to provide a guide to various clinical protocols that are commonly used. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;36:529--542.

This work presents a new iterative reconstruction method based on the total generalized variation, which reduces this artifact. For this approach, a sampling operator (as well as its adjoint) is needed that maps data from PatLoc k-space to the final image space. It is shown that this can be realized as a type-3 nonuniform fast Fourier transform, which is implemented by a combination of a type-1 and type-2 nonuniform fast Fourier transform. Using this operator, it is also possible to implement an iterative conjugate gradient SENSE based method for PatLoc reconstruction, which leads to a significant reduction of computation time in comparison to conventional PatLoc image reconstruction methods. Results from numerical simulations and in vivo PatLoc measurements with as few as 16 radial projections are presented, which demonstrate significant improvements in image quality with the total generalized variation-based approach.

Methods Julia is a modern, general purpose programming language with strong features in the area of signal/image processing and numerical computing. It has a high-level syntax but still generates efficient machine code that is usually as fast as comparable C/C++ applications. In addition to the language features itself, Julia has a sophisticated package management system that makes proper modularization of functionality across different packages feasible. Our developed MRI reconstruction framework MRIReco.jl can therefore reuse existing functionality from other Julia packages and concentrate on the MRI-related parts. This includes common imaging operators and support for MRI raw data formats. Results MRIReco.jl is a simple to use framework with a high degree of accessibility. While providing a simple-to-use interface, many of its components can easily be extended and customized. The performance of MRIReco.jl is compared to the Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) and we show that the Julia framework achieves comparable reconstruction speed as the popular C/C++ library. Conclusions Modern programming languages can bridge the gap between high performance and accessible implementations. MRIReco.jl leverages this fact and contributes a promising environment for future algorithmic development in MRI reconstruction.},

MRF using fast imaging with steady-state precession (MRF-FISP) has robustness to off-resonance artifacts and has many applications in inhomogeneous fields. However, the spoiler gradient used in MRF-FISP is sensitive to diffusion motion, and may lead to quantification errors when the spoiler moment increases. In this study, we examined the effect of the diffusion weighting in MRF-FISP caused by spoiler gradients. The T2 relaxation times were greatly underestimated when large spoiler moments were used. The T2 underestimation was prominent for tissues with large values of T2 and diffusion coefficients. The T2 bias was almost independent of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2 values when the ADC map was measured and incorporated into the matching process. These results reveal that the T2 underestimation resulted from the diffusion weighting caused by the spoiler gradients.},

The results demonstrated that the calculation speed using two GPU boards was typically about 7 TFLOPS and about 14 times faster than the calculation speed using CPUs (two 18-core Xeons). We also found that MR images acquired by experiment could be reproduced using an appropriate number of subvoxels, and that 3D isotropic and two-dimensional multislice imaging experiments for practical matrix sizes could be simulated using the MRI simulator. Therefore, we concluded that such powerful MRI simulators are expected to become an indispensable tool for MRI research and development.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a fast 3D MRI simulator for arbitrary k-space sampling using a graphical processing unit (GPU) and demonstrate its performance by comparing simulation and experimental results in a real MRI system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A fast 3D MRI simulator using a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU (NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was developed using C++ and the CUDA 8.0 platform (NVIDIA Corporation). The unique advantage of this simulator was that it could use the same pulse sequence as used in the experiment. The performance of the MRI simulator was measured using two GTX 1080 GPUs and 3D Cones sequences. The MRI simulation results for 3D non-Cartesian sampling trajectories like 3D Cones sequences using a numerical 3D phantom were compared with the experimental results obtained with a real MRI system and a real 3D phantom. RESULTS: The performance of the MRI simulator was about 3800-4900 gigaflops for 128- to 4-shot 3D Cones sequences with 2563 voxels, which was about 60\% of the performance of the previous MRI simulator optimized for Cartesian sampling calculated for a Cartesian sampling gradient-echo sequence with 2563 voxels. The effects of the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, radio-frequency field inhomogeneity, gradient field nonlinearity, and fast repetition times on the MR images were reproduced in the simulated images as observed in the experimental images. CONCLUSION: The 3D MRI simulator developed for arbitrary k-space sampling optimized using GPUs is a powerful tool for the development and evaluation of advanced imaging sequences including both Cartesian and non-Cartesian k-space sampling.},

The study was institutional review board approved, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Twenty-nine patients (18 men, 11 women; mean age, 57.1 years {\textpm} 14.3 [standard deviation]) suspected of having RAS underwent MR angiography. Images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. The interobserver variability, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 3-T MR angiography, as compared with DSA (performed in 15 patients), were calculated. All examinations yielded good or excellent image quality. The sensitivity and specificity of MR angiography in grading significant ({$>$}75\%) stenosis were 94\% and 96\%, respectively. Owing to its high sensitivity, contrast-enhanced 3-T MR angiography can be used reliably to exclude RAS and can serve as a useful screening method in the diagnostic work-up of patients with arterial hypertension. {\copyright} RSNA, 2008}

Respiratory self-gating (RSG) approaches improve motion detection only in the head--feet direction, leaving motion in the other two dimensions unaccounted for. The purpose of this study was to extend conventional RSG (1D RSG) to RSG capable of 3D motion detection (3D RSG) by acquiring additional RSG projections with transverse-motion-encoding gradients. Simulation and volunteer studies were conducted to validate the effectiveness of this new method. Preliminary comparison was performed between coronary artery images reconstructed from the same datasets using different motion correction methods. Our simulation illustrates that a proper motion-encoding gradient and derivation method enable accurate 3D motion detection. Results from whole-heart coronary MRA show that 3D RSG can further reduce motion artifacts as compared to NAV and 1D RSG and enables use of larger gating windows for faster coronary imaging.

  abstract = {Motion is a major confound in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the body, and it is a common cause of image artefacts. The effects are particularly severe in cardiac applications, due to the nonrigid cyclical deformation of the myocardium. Spin echo-based DWI commonly employs gradient moment-nulling techniques to desensitise the acquisition to velocity and acceleration, ie, nulling gradient moments up to the 2nd order (M2-nulled). However, current M2-nulled DWI scans are limited to encode diffusion along a single direction at a time. We propose a method for designing b-tensors of arbitrary shapes, including planar, spherical, prolate and oblate tensors, while nulling gradient moments up to the 2nd order and beyond. The design strategy comprises initialising the diffusion encoding gradients in two encoding blocks about the refocusing pulse, followed by appropriate scaling and rotation, which further enables nulling undesired effects of concomitant gradients. Proof-of-concept assessment of in vivo mean diffusivity (MD) was performed using linear and spherical tensor encoding (LTE and STE, respectively) in the hearts of five healthy volunteers. The results of the M2-nulled STE showed that (a) the sequence was robust to cardiac motion, and (b) MD was higher than that acquired using standard M2-nulled LTE, where diffusion-weighting was applied in three orthogonal directions, which may be attributed to the presence of restricted diffusion and microscopic diffusion anisotropy. Provided adequate signal-to-noise ratio, STE could significantly shorten estimation of MD compared with the conventional LTE approach. Importantly, our theoretical analysis and the proposed gradient waveform design may be useful in microstructure imaging beyond diffusion tensor imaging where the effects of motion must be suppressed.},

Many textbooks provide in-depth descriptions and derivations of the various concepts. Still, carrying out numerical Bloch equation simulations of the signal evolution can oftentimes supplement and enrich one's understanding. And though it may appear intimidating at first, performing these simulations is within the realm of every imager. The primary objective herein is to provide novice MR users with the necessary and basic conceptual, algorithmic and computational tools to confidently write their own simulator. A brief background of the idealized MR imaging process, its concepts and the pulse sequence diagram are first provided. Thereafter, two regimes of Bloch equation simulations are presented, the first which has no radio frequency (RF) pulses, and the second in which RF pulses are applied. For the first regime, analytical solutions are given, whereas for the second regime, an overview of the computationally efficient, but often overlooked, Rodrigues' rotation formula is given. Lastly, various simulation conditions of interest and example code snippets are given and discussed to help demonstrate how straightforward and easy performing MR simulations can be.},

  abstract = {Purpose Implementing new magnetic resonance experiments, or sequences, often involves extensive programming on vendor-specific platforms, which can be time consuming and costly. This situation is exacerbated when research sequences need to be implemented on several platforms simultaneously, for example, at different field strengths. This work presents an alternative programming environment that is hardware-independent, open-source, and promotes rapid sequence prototyping. Methods A novel file format is described to efficiently store the hardware events and timing information required for an MR pulse sequence. Platform-dependent interpreter modules convert the file to appropriate instructions to run the sequence on MR hardware. Sequences can be designed in high-level languages, such as MATLAB, or with a graphical interface. Spin physics simulation tools are incorporated into the framework, allowing for comparison between real and virtual experiments. Results Minimal effort is required to implement relatively advanced sequences using the tools provided. Sequences are executed on three different MR platforms, demonstrating the flexibility of the approach. Conclusion A high-level, flexible and hardware-independent approach to sequence programming is ideal for the rapid development of new sequences. The framework is currently not suitable for large patient studies or routine scanning although this would be possible with deeper integration into existing workflows.

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI was introduced in 1985, showing how the diffusive motion of molecules, especially water, could be spatially encoded with MRI to produce images revealing the underlying structure of biologic tissues at a microscopic scale. Diffusion is one of several Intravoxel Incoherent Motions (IVIM) accessible to MRI together with blood microcirculation. Diffusion imaging first revolutionized the management of acute cerebral ischemia by allowing diagnosis at an acute stage when therapies can still work, saving the outcomes of many patients. Since then, the field of diffusion imaging has expanded to the whole body, with broad applications in both clinical and research settings, providing insights into tissue integrity, structural and functional abnormalities from the hindered diffusive movement of water molecules in tissues. Diffusion imaging is particularly used to manage many neurologic disorders and in oncology for detecting and classifying cancer lesions, as well as monitoring treatment response at an early stage. The second major impact of diffusion imaging concerns the wiring of the brain (Diffusion Tensor Imaging, DTI), allowing to obtain from the anisotropic movement of water molecules in the brain white-matter images in 3 dimensions of the brain connections making up the Connectome. DTI has opened up new avenues of clinical diagnosis and research to investigate brain diseases, neurogenesis and aging, with a rapidly extending field of application in psychiatry, revealing how mental illnesses could be seen as Connectome spacetime disorders. Adding that water diffusion is closely associated to neuronal activity, as shown from diffusion fMRI, one may consider that diffusion MRI is ideally suited to investigate both brain structure and function. This article retraces the early days and milestones of diffusion MRI which spawned over 40~years, showing how diffusion MRI emerged and expanded in the research and clinical fields, up to become a pillar of modern clinical imaging.},

Using mouse brain ex vivo, we compared STI with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in terms of tensor values, principal tensor values, anisotropy values, and tensor orientations. Despite the completely different biophysical underpinnings, magnetic susceptibility tensors and diffusion tensors show many similarities in the tensor and principal tensor images, for example, the tensors perpendicular to the fiber direction have the highest gray-white matter contrast, and the largest principal tensor is along the fiber direction. Comparison to DTI fractional anisotropy, the susceptibility anisotropy provides much higher sensitivity to the chemical composition of the white matter, especially myelin. The high sensitivity can be further enhanced with the perfusion of ProHance, a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Regarding the tensor orientations, the direction of the largest principal susceptibility tensor agrees with that of diffusion tensors in major white matter fiber bundles. The STI fiber tractography can reconstruct the fiber pathways for the whole corpus callosum and for white matter fiber bundles that are in close contact but in different orientations. There are some differences between susceptibility and diffusion tensor orientations, which are likely due to the limitations in the current STI reconstruction. With the development of more accurate reconstruction methods, STI holds the promise for probing the white matter micro-architectures with more anatomical details and higher chemical sensitivity.},

  abstract = {The complex transverse water proton magnetization subject to diffusion-encoding magnetic field gradient pulses in a heterogeneous medium such as brain tissue can be modeled by the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation. The spatial integral of the solution of this equation in realistic geometry provides a gold-standard reference model for the diffusion MRI signal arising from different tissue micro-structures of interest. A closed form representation of this reference diffusion MRI signal called matrix formalism, which makes explicit the link between the Laplace eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the biological cell and its diffusion MRI signal, was derived 20 years ago. In addition, once the Laplace eigendecomposition has been computed and saved, the diffusion MRI signal can be calculated for arbitrary diffusion-encoding sequences and b-values at negligible additional cost. Up to now, this representation, though mathematically elegant, has not been often used as a practical model of the diffusion MRI signal, due to the difficulties of calculating the Laplace eigendecomposition in complicated geometries. In this paper, we present a simulation framework that we have implemented inside the MATLAB-based diffusion MRI simulator SpinDoctor that efficiently computes the matrix formalism representation for realistic neurons using the finite element method. We show that the matrix formalism representation requires a few hundred eigenmodes to match the reference signal computed by solving the Bloch-Torrey equation when the cell geometry originates from realistic neurons. As expected, the number of eigenmodes required to match the reference signal increases with smaller diffusion time and higher b-values. We also convert the eigenvalues to a length scale and illustrate the link between the length scale and the oscillation frequency of the eigenmode in the cell geometry. We give the transformation that links the Laplace eigenfunctions to the eigenfunctions of the Bloch-Torrey operator and compute the Bloch-Torrey eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. This work is another step in bringing advanced mathematical tools and numerical method development to the simulation and modeling of diffusion MRI.},

  abstract = {Purpose Develop a novel 2D cardiac MR fingerprinting (MRF) approach to enable simultaneous T1, T2, T2*, and fat fraction (FF) myocardial tissue characterization in a single breath-hold scan. Methods Simultaneous, co-registered, multi-parametric mapping of T1, T2, and FF has been recently achieved with cardiac MRF. Here, we further incorporate T2* quantification within this approach, enabling simultaneous T1, T2, T2*, and FF myocardial tissue characterization in a single breath-hold scan. T2* quantification is achieved with an eight-echo readout that requires a long cardiac acquisition window. A novel low-rank motion-corrected (LRMC) reconstruction is exploited to correct for cardiac motion within the long acquisition window. The proposed T1/T2/T2*/FF cardiac MRF was evaluated in phantom and in 10 healthy subjects in comparison to conventional mapping techniques. Results The proposed approach achieved high quality parametric mapping of T1, T2, T2*, and FF with corresponding normalized RMS error (RMSE) T1 = 5.9\%, T2 = 9.6\% (T2 values {$<$}100 ms), T2* = 3.3\% (T2* values {$<$}100 ms), and FF = 0.8\% observed in phantom scans. In vivo, the proposed approach produced higher left-ventricular myocardial T1 values than MOLLI (1148 vs 1056 ms), lower T2 values than T2-GraSE (42.8 vs 50.6 ms), lower T2* values than eight-echo gradient echo (GRE) (35.0 vs 39.4 ms), and higher FF values than six-echo GRE (0.8 vs 0.3 \%) reference techniques. The proposed approach achieved considerable reduction in motion artifacts compared to cardiac MRF without motion correction, improved spatial uniformity, and statistically higher apparent precision relative to conventional mapping for all parameters. Conclusion The proposed cardiac MRF approach enables simultaneous, co-registered mapping of T1, T2, T2*, and FF in a single breath-hold for comprehensive myocardial tissue characterization, achieving higher apparent precision than conventional methods.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Develop a sparse and locally low rank (LLR) regularized reconstruction to accelerate MR fingerprinting (MRF). METHODS: Recent works have introduced low rank reconstructions to MRF, based on temporal compression operators learned from the MRF dictionary. In other MR applications, LLR regularization has been introduced to exploit temporal redundancy in local regions of the image. Here, we propose to include spatial sparsity and LLR regularization terms in the MRF reconstruction. This approach, so called SLLR-MRF, further reduces aliasing in the time-point images and enables higher acceleration factors. The proposed approach was evaluated in simulations, T1 /T2 phantom acquisition, and in vivo brain acquisitions in 5 healthy subjects with different undersampling factors. Acceleration was also used in vivo to enable acquisitions with higher in-plane spatial resolution in comparable scan time. RESULTS: Simulations, phantom, and in vivo results show that low rank MRF reconstructions with high acceleration factors ({$<$}875 time-point images, 1 radial spoke per time-point) have residual aliasing artifacts that propagate into the parametric maps. The artifacts are reduced with the proposed SLLR-MRF resulting in considerable improvements in precision, without changes in accuracy. In vivo results show improved parametric maps for the proposed SLLR-MRF, potentially enabling MRF acquisitions with 1 radial spoke per time-point in approximately 2.6 s ({\textasciitilde}600 time-point images) for 2 {\texttimes} 2 mm and 9.6 s (1750 time-point images) for 1 {\texttimes} 1 mm in-plane resolution. CONCLUSION: The proposed SLLR-MRF reconstruction further improves parametric map quality compared with low rank MRF, enabling shorter scan times and/or increased spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work was to assess the feasibility of performing MRF in the liver on a 0.55~T scanner and to examine the feasibility of water-fat separation using rosette MRF at 0.55~T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spiral and rosette MRF sequences were implemented on a commercial 0.55~T scanner. The accuracy of both sequences in T1 and T2 quantification was validated in the ISMRM/NIST system phantom. The efficacy of rosette MRF in water-fat separation was evaluated in simulations and water/oil phantoms. Both spiral and rosette MRF were performed in the liver of healthy subjects. RESULTS: In the ISMRM/NIST phantom, both spiral and rosette MRF achieved good agreement with reference values in T1 and T2 measurements. In addition, rosette MRF enables water-fat separation and can generate water- and fat- specific T1 maps, T2 maps, and proton density images from the same dataset for a spatial resolution of 1.56\,{\texttimes}\,1.56\,{\texttimes}\,5mm3 within the acquisition time of 15~s. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to measure T1 and T2 simultaneously in the liver using MRF on a 0.55~T system with lower performance gradients compared to state-of-the-art 1.5~T and 3~T systems within an acquisition time of 15~s. In addition, rosette MRF enables water-fat separation along with T1 and T2 quantification with no time penalty.},

MRiLab combines realistic tissue modeling with numerical virtualization of an MRI system and scanning experiment to enable assessment of a broad range of MRI approaches including advanced quantitative MRI methods inferring microstructure on a sub-voxel level. A flexible representation of tissue microstructure is achieved in MRiLab by employing the generalized tissue model with multiple exchanging water and macromolecular proton pools rather than a system of independent proton isochromats typically used in previous simulators. The computational power needed for simulation of the biologically relevant tissue models in large 3D objects is gained using parallelized execution on GPU. Three simulated and one actual MRI experiments were performed to demonstrate the ability of the new simulator to accommodate a wide variety of voxel composition scenarios and demonstrate detrimental effects of simplified treatment of tissue micro-organization adapted in previous simulators. GPU execution allowed 200{\texttimes} improvement in computational speed over standard CPU.

Detailed understanding of this contrast may provide meaningful diagnostic information. In this communication, we report an observation of extensive anisotropic magnetic susceptibility in the white matter of the central nervous system. Furthermore, we describe a susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) technique to measure and quantify this phenomenon. This technique relies on the measurement of resonance frequency offset at different orientations with respect to the main magnetic field. We propose to characterize this orientation variation using an apparent susceptibility tensor. The susceptibility tensor can be decomposed into three eigenvalues (principal susceptibilities) and associated eigenvectors that are coordinate-system independent. We show that the principal susceptibilities offer strong contrast between gray and white matter while the eigenvectors provide orientation information of an underlying magnetic network. We believe that this network may further offer information of white matter fiber orientation.},

  abstract = {In this study we aimed to assess the effects of continuous formalin fixation on diffusion and relaxation metrics of the ex vivo porcine heart at 7 T. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on eight piglet hearts using a 7 T whole body system. Hearts were measured fresh within 3 hours of cardiac arrest followed by immersion in 10\% neutral buffered formalin. T2* and T2 were assessed using a gradient multi-echo and multi-echo spin echo sequence, respectively. A spin echo and a custom stimulated echo sequence were employed to assess diffusion time-dependent changes in metrics of cardiac diffusion tensor imaging. SNR was determined for b = 0 images. Scans were performed for 5 mm thick apical, midcavity and basal slices (in-plane resolution: 1 mm) and repeated 7, 15, 50, 100 and 200 days postfixation. Eigenvalues of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) following fixation. Relative to fresh hearts, FA values 7 and 200 days postfixation were 90\% and 80\%, while respective relative ADC values at those fixation stages were 78\% and 92\%. Statistical helix and sheetlet angle distributions as well as respective mean and median values showed no systematic influence of continuous formalin fixation. Similar to changes in the ADC, values for T2, T2* and SNR dropped initially postfixation. Respective relative values compared with fresh hearts at day 7 were 64\%, 79\% and 68\%, whereas continuous fixation restored T2, T2* and SNR leading to relative values of 74\%, 100\%, and 81\% at day 200, respectively. Relaxation parameters and diffusion metrics are significantly altered by continuous formalin fixation. The preservation of microstructure metrics following prolonged fixation is a key finding that may enable future studies of ventricular remodeling in cardiac pathologies.},

Combined with a flexible, task-driven cost function this allows for an efficient exploration of novel MR sequence strategies. Methods The scanning and reconstruction process is simulated end-to-end in terms of RF events, gradient moment events in x and y, and delay times, acting on the input model spin system given in terms of proton density, and , and . As a proof of concept, we use both conventional MR images and maps as targets and optimize from scratch using the loss defined by data fidelity, SAR penalty, and scan time. Results In a first attempt, MRzero learns gradient and RF events from zero, and is able to generate a target image produced by a conventional gradient echo sequence. Using a neural network within the reconstruction module allows arbitrary targets to be learned successfully. Experiments could be translated to image acquisition at the real system (3T Siemens, PRISMA) and could be verified in the measurements of phantoms and a human brain in vivo.

Real-time tracking will play an important role in the non-invasive treatment of atrial fibrillation with MRI-guided radiosurgery. In addition, to show how quantifiable measures of tracking accuracy and patient-specific physiology could influence MRI tracking algorithm design. Methods Twenty virtual patients were subjected to simulated MRI scans that closely model the proposed real-world scenario to allow verification of the tracking technique's algorithm. The generated phantoms provide ground-truth motions which were compared to the target motions output from our tracking algorithm. The patient-specific tracking error, ep, was the 3D difference (vector length) between the ground-truth and algorithm trajectories. The tracking errors of two combinations of new tracking algorithm functions that were anticipated to improve tracking accuracy were studied. Additionally, the correlation of key physiological parameters with tracking accuracy was investigated. Results Our original cardiac tracking algorithm resulted in a mean tracking error of 3.7 {\textpm} 0.6 mm over all virtual patients. The two combinations of tracking functions demonstrated comparable mean tracking errors however indicating that the optimal tracking algorithm may be patient-specific. Conclusions Current and future MRI tracking strategies are likely to benefit from this virtual validation method since no time-resolved 4D ground-truth signal can currently be derived from purely image-based studies.},

  abstract = {What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.},

Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain--for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the {$\ell$}1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance is an exceptionally powerful and versatile measurement technique. The basic structure of a magnetic resonance experiment has remained largely unchanged for almost 50 years, being mainly restricted to the qualitative probing of only a limited set of the properties that can in principle be accessed by this technique. Here we introduce an approach to data acquisition, post-processing and visualization---which we term `magnetic resonance fingerprinting' (MRF)---that permits the simultaneous non-invasive quantification of multiple important properties of a material or tissue. MRF thus provides an alternative way to quantitatively detect and analyse complex changes that can represent physical alterations of a substance or early indicators of disease. MRF can also be used to identify the presence of a specific target material or tissue, which will increase the sensitivity, specificity and speed of a magnetic resonance study, and potentially lead to new diagnostic testing methodologies. When paired with an appropriate pattern-recognition algorithm, MRF inherently suppresses measurement errors and can thus improve measurement accuracy.},

  abstract = {The susceptibility of super paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles makes them a useful contrast agent for different purposes in MRI. These particles are typically quantified with relaxometry or by measuring the inhomogeneities they produced. These methods rely on the phase, which is unreliable for high concentrations. We present in this study a novel Deep Learning method to quantify the SPIO concentration distribution. We acquired the data with a new sequence called View Line in which the field map information is encoded in the geometry of the image. The novelty of our network is that it uses residual blocks as the bottleneck and multiple decoders to improve the gradient flow in the network. Each decoder predicts a different part of the wavelet decomposition of the concentration map. This decomposition improves the estimation of the concentration, and also it accelerates the convergence of the model. We tested our SPIO concentration reconstruction technique with simulated images and data from actual scans from phantoms. The simulations were done using images from the IXI dataset, and the phantoms consisted of plastic cylinders containing agar with SPIO particles at different concentrations. In both experiments, the model was able to quantify the distribution accurately.},

  abstract = {Purpose To describe SequenceTree, an open source, integrated software environment for implementing MRI pulse sequences and, ideally, exporting them to actual MRI scanners. The software is a user-friendly alternative to vendor-supplied pulse sequence design and editing tools and is suited for programmers and nonprogrammers alike. Methods The integrated user interface was programmed using the Qt4/C++ toolkit. As parameters and code are modified, the pulse sequence diagram is automatically updated within the user interface. Several aspects of pulse programming are handled automatically, allowing users to focus on higher-level aspects of sequence design. Sequences can be simulated using a built-in Bloch equation solver and then exported for use on a Siemens MRI scanner. Ideally, other types of scanners will be supported in the future. Results SequenceTree has been used for 8 years in our laboratory and elsewhere and has contributed to more than 50 peer-reviewed publications in areas such as cardiovascular imaging, solid state and nonproton NMR, MR elastography, and high-resolution structural imaging. Conclusion SequenceTree is an innovative, open source, visual pulse sequence environment for MRI combining simplicity with flexibility and is ideal both for advanced users and users with limited programming experience.

  abstract = {Purpose To assess respiratory motion models for coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA). In this study various motion models that describe the respiration-induced 3D displacements and deformations of the main coronary arteries were compared. Materials and Methods Multiple high-resolution 3D coronary MR images were acquired in healthy volunteers using navigator-based respiratory gating, each depicting the coronary vessels at different respiratory motion states. In the images representing the different inspiratory states the displacements and deformations of the main coronary vessels with respect to the end-expiratory state were determined, by means of elastic registration. Several correction models (superior-inferior (SI) translation, 3D translation, and 3D affine transformation) were tested and compared with respect to their ability to map a selected inspiratory to the end-expiratory motion state. Results 3D translation was found to be superior over SI translation, which is commonly used for prospective motion correction in CMRA. The 3D affine transformation was found to be the best correction model considered in this study. Furthermore, a large intersubject variability of the model parameters was observed. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that a patient-adapted 3D correction model (3D translation or better 3D affine) will considerably improve prospective motion correction in CMRA. J. Magn.

It is based on a Halbach-type magnet design which mimics the field of a spherical dipole by using cylindrical bar and ring magnets. The magnet system is made up of only three individual magnets, and most field calculations and optimisations can be performed analytically. A prototype system has been built using a set of small, off the shelf commercially available permanent magnets. Proton linewidths of 50ppm FWHM could be achieved at a field strength of 1T. Calculations show that with custom-sized permanent magnets, linewidths of less than 1ppm can be achieved over sample volumes of up to 1mm3, which would in theory enable chemical shift resolved proton spectroscopy on mass-limited samples. But even with the achieved linewidth of 50ppm, this can be a useful portable sensor for small amounts of liquid samples with restricted molecular mobility, like gels, polymers or high viscosity liquids.},

  abstract = {Historically, clinical MRI started with main magnetic field strengths in the {$\sim$}0.05-0.35T range. In the past 40 years there have been considerable developments in MRI hardware, with one of the primary ones being the trend to higher magnetic fields. While resulting in large improvements in data quality and diagnostic value, such developments have meant that conventional systems at 1.5 and 3T remain relatively expensive pieces of medical imaging equipment, and are out of the financial reach for much of the world. In this review we describe the current state-of-the-art of low-field systems (defined as 0.25-1T), both with respect to its low cost, low foot-print, and subject accessibility. Furthermore, we discuss how low field could potentially benefit from many of the developments that have occurred in higher-field MRI. In the first section, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) dependence on the static magnetic field and its impact on the achievable contrast, resolution, and acquisition times are discussed from a theoretical perspective. In the second section, developments in hardware (eg, magnet, gradient, and RF coils) used both in experimental low-field scanners and also those that are currently in the market are reviewed. In the final section the potential roles of new acquisition readouts, motion tracking, and image reconstruction strategies, currently being developed primarily at higher fields, are presented.

  abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging can reveal quantitative information about the tissue changes in multiple sclerosis. The recently developed multi-compartment spherical mean technique can map different microscopic properties based only on local diffusion signals, and it may provide specific information on the underlying microstructural modifications that arise in multiple sclerosis. Given that the lesions in multiple sclerosis may reflect different degrees of damage, we hypothesized that quantitative diffusion maps may help characterize the severity of lesions ``in vivo'' and correlate these to an individual's clinical profile. We evaluated this in a cohort of 59 multiple sclerosis patients (62\% female, mean age 44.7~years), for whom demographic and disease information was obtained, and who underwent a comprehensive physical and cognitive evaluation. The magnetic resonance imaging protocol included conventional sequences to define focal lesions, and multi-shell diffusion imaging was used with b-values of 1000, 2000 and 3000~s/mm2 in 180 encoding directions. Quantitative diffusion properties on a macro- and micro-scale were used to discriminate distinct types of lesions through a k-means clustering algorithm, and the number and volume of those lesion types were correlated with parameters of the disease. The combination of diffusion tensor imaging metrics (fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity) and multi-compartment spherical mean technique values (microscopic fractional anisotropy and intra-neurite volume fraction) differentiated two type of lesions, with a prediction strength of 0.931. The B-type lesions had larger diffusion changes compared to the A-type lesions, irrespective of their location (P~{$<~$}0.001). The number of A and B type lesions was similar, although in juxtacortical areas B-type lesions predominated (60\%, P~{$<~$}0.001). Also, the percentage of B-type lesion volume was higher (64\%, P~{$<~$}0.001), indicating that these lesions were larger. The number and volume of B-type lesions was related to the severity of disease evolution, clinical disability and cognitive decline (P~=~0.004, Bonferroni correction). Specifically, more and larger B-type lesions were correlated with a worse Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score, cerebellar function and cognitive performance. Thus, by combining several microscopic and macroscopic diffusion properties, the severity of damage within focal lesions can be characterized, further contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms that drive disease evolution. Accordingly, the classification of lesion types has the potential to permit more specific and better-targeted treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis.},

The modified Bloch equations are easily solved in the slow passage case, with arbitrary rf saturation. Earlier relations between reaction rates, and resonance line shapes, which were developed by Gutowsky, McCall, and Slichter, and extended by a number of other investigators, are easily derived using the modified Bloch equations. In the present work the modified equations are used to show how rapid exchange rates can sometimes be measured in solutions where the X relaxation times are relatively long in one system, A, and short in the second, B.},

Each modified LL inversion recovery (MOLLI) study consisted of three successive LL inversion recovery (IR) experiments with different inversion times. We acquired images in late diastole using a single-shot steady-state free-precession (SSFP) technique, combined with sensitivity encoding to achieve a data acquisition window of {$<$} 200 ms duration. We calculated T1 using signal intensities from regions of interest and pixel by pixel. T1 accuracy at different heart rates derived from simulated ECG signals was tested in phantoms. T1 estimates showed small systematic error for T1 values from 191 to 1196 ms. In vivo T1 mapping was performed in two healthy volunteers and in one patient with acute myocardial infarction before and after administration of Gd-DTPA. T1 values for myocardium and noncardiac structures were in good agreement with values available from the literature. The region of infarction was clearly visualized.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracellular matrix expansion is a key element of ventricular remodeling and a potential therapeutic target. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T1-mapping techniques are increasingly used to evaluate myocardial extracellular volume (ECV); however, the most widely applied methods are without histological validation. Our aim was to perform comprehensive validation of (1) dynamic-equilibrium CMR (DynEq-CMR), where ECV is quantified using hematocrit-adjusted myocardial and blood T1 values measured before and after gadolinium bolus; and (2) isolated measurement of myocardial T1, used as an ECV surrogate. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-heart histological validation was performed using 96 tissue samples, analyzed for picrosirius red collagen volume fraction, obtained from each of 16 segments of the explanted hearts of 6 patients undergoing heart transplantation who had prospectively undergone CMR before transplantation (median interval between CMR and transplantation, 29 days). DynEq-CMR-derived ECV was calculated from T1 measurements made using a modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence before and 10 and 15 minutes post contrast. In addition, ECV was measured 2 to 20 minutes post contrast in 30 healthy volunteers. There was a strong linear relationship between DynEq-CMR-derived ECV and histological collagen volume fraction (P{$<$}0.001; within-subject: r=0.745; P{$<$}0.001; r(2)=0.555 and between-subject: r=0.945; P{$<$}0.01; r(2)=0.893; for ECV calculated using 15-minute postcontrast T1). Correlation was maintained throughout the entire heart. Isolated postcontrast T1 measurement showed significant within-subject correlation with histological collagen volume fraction (r=-0.741; P{$<$}0.001; r(2)=0.550 for 15-minute postcontrast T1), but between-subject correlations were not significant. DynEq-CMR-derived ECV varied significantly according to contrast dose, myocardial region, and sex. CONCLUSIONS: DynEq-CMR-derived ECV shows a good correlation with histological collagen volume fraction throughout the whole heart. Isolated postcontrast T1 measurement is insufficient for ECV assessment.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop a motion-corrected 3D flow-insensitive imaging approach interleaved T2 prepared-inversion recovery (iT2prep-IR) for simultaneous lumen and wall visualization of the great thoracic vessels and cardiac structures. Methods A 3D flow-insensitive approach for simultaneous cardiovascular lumen and wall visualization (iT2prep) has been previously proposed. This approach requires subject-dependent weighted subtraction to completely null the arterial blood signal in the black-blood volume. Here, we propose an (T2prep-IR) approach to improve wall visualization and remove need for weighted subtraction. The proposed sequence is based on the acquisition and direct subtraction of 2 interleaved 3D whole-heart data sets acquired with and without T2prep-IR preparation. Image navigators are acquired before data acquisition to enable 2D translational and 3D non-rigid motion correction allowing 100\% respiratory scan efficiency. The proposed approach was evaluated in 10 healthy subjects and compared with the conventional 2D double inversion recovery (DIR) sequence and the 3D iT2prep sequence. Additionally, 5 patients with congenital heart disease were acquired to test the clinical feasibility of the proposed approach. Results The proposed iT2prep-IR sequence showed improved blood nulling compared to both DIR and iT2prep techniques in terms of SNR (SNRblood = 6.9, 12.2, and 18.2, respectively) and contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNRmyoc-blood = 28.4, 15.4, and 15.3, respectively). No statistical difference was observed between iT2prep-IR, iT2prep and DIR atrial and ventricular wall thickness quantification. Conclusion The proposed interleaved T2prep-IR sequence enables the simultaneous lumen and wall visualization of cardiac structures and shows promising results in terms of SNR, CNR, and wall thickness measurement.},

  abstract = {While nonenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiographic methods have been available since the earliest days of MR imaging, prolonged acquisition times and image artifacts have generally limited their use in favor of gadolinium-enhanced MR angiographic techniques. However, the combination of recent technical advances and new concerns about the safety of gadolinium-based contrast agents has spurred a resurgence of interest in methods that do not require exogenous contrast material. After a review of basic considerations in vascular imaging, the established methods for nonenhanced MR angiographic techniques, such as time of flight and phase contrast, are considered and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. This article then focuses on new techniques that are becoming commercially available, such as electrocardiographically gated partial-Fourier fast spin-echo methods and balanced steady-state free precession imaging both with and without arterial spin labeling. Challenges facing these methods and possible solutions are considered. Since different imaging techniques rely on different mechanisms of image contrast, recommendations are offered for which strategies may work best for specific angiographic applications. Developments on the horizon include techniques that provide time-resolved imaging for assessment of flow dynamics by using nonenhanced approaches. {\copyright} RSNA, 2008}

These capabilities introduce a new frontier in cardiology, enabling the practitioner/investigator to quantify biologically important myocardial properties that otherwise can be difficult to ascertain clinically. CMR may be able to track biologically important changes in the myocardium by: a) native T1 that reflects myocardial disease involving the myocyte and interstitium without use of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA), or b) the extracellular volume fraction (ECV)--a direct GBCA-based measurement of the size of the extracellular space, reflecting interstitial disease. The latter technique attempts to dichotomize the myocardium into its cellular and interstitial components with estimates expressed as volume fractions. This document provides recommendations for clinical and research T1 and ECV measurement, based on published evidence when available and expert consensus when not. We address site preparation, scan type, scan planning and acquisition, quality control, visualisation and analysis, technical development. We also address controversies in the field. While ECV and native T1 mapping appear destined to affect clinical decision making, they lack multi-centre application and face significant challenges, which demand a community-wide approach among stakeholders. At present, ECV and native T1 mapping appear sufficiently robust for many diseases; yet more research is required before a large-scale application for clinical decision-making can be recommended.},

Enzyme synthesizes gradients for programs written in any language whose compiler targets LLVM IR including C, C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Swift, MLIR, etc., thereby providing native AD capabilities in these languages. Unlike traditional source-to-source and operator-overloading tools, Enzyme performs AD on optimized IR. On a machine-learning focused benchmark suite including Microsoft's ADBench, AD on optimized IR achieves a geometric mean speedup of 4.2 times over AD on IR before optimization allowing Enzyme to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Enzyme is a LLVM compiler plugin that performs reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) and thus generates high performance gradients of programs in languages including C/C++, Fortran, Julia, and Rust. Prior to this work, Enzyme and other AD tools were not capable of generating gradients of GPU kernels. Our paper presents a combination of novel techniques that make Enzyme the first fully automatic reversemode AD tool to generate gradients of GPU kernels. Since unlike other tools Enzyme performs automatic differentiation within a general-purpose compiler, we are able to introduce several novel GPU and AD-specific optimizations. To show the generality and efficiency of our approach, we compute gradients of five GPU-based HPC applications, executed on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. All benchmarks run within an order of magnitude of the original program's execution time. Without GPU and AD-specific optimizations, gradients of GPU kernels either fail to run from a lack of resources or have infeasible overhead. Finally, we demonstrate that increasing the problem size by either increasing the number of threads or increasing the work per thread, does not substantially impact the overhead from differentiation.},

  abstract = {Purpose Cardiomyocyte organization and performance underlie cardiac function, but the in vivo mobility of these cells during contraction and filling remains difficult to probe. Herein, a novel trigger delay (TD) scout sequence was used to acquire high in-plane resolution (1.6 mm) Spin-Echo (SE) cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) at three distinct cardiac phases. The objective was to characterize cardiomyocyte organization and mobility throughout the cardiac cycle in healthy volunteers. Materials and methods Nine healthy volunteers were imaged with cDTI at three distinct cardiac phases (early systole, late systole, and diastasis). The sequence used a free-breathing Spin-Echo (SE) cDTI protocol (b-values = 350s/mm2, twelve diffusion encoding directions, eight repetitions) to acquire high-resolution images (1.6x1.6x8mm3) at 3T in {\textasciitilde}7 minutes/cardiac phase. Helix Angle (HA), Helix Angle Range (HAR), E2 angle (E2A), Transverse Angle (TA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), diffusion tensor eigenvalues ({$\lambda$}1-2-3), and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in the left ventricle (LV) were characterized. Results Images from the patient-specific TD scout sequence demonstrated that SE cDTI acquisition was possible at early systole, late systole, and diastasis in 78\%, 100\% and 67\% of the cases, respectively. At the mid-ventricular level, mobility (reported as median [IQR]) was observed in HAR between early systole and late systole (76.9 [72.6, 80.5]{$^\circ$} vs 96.6 [85.9, 100.3]{$^\circ$}, p{$<$}0.001). E2A also changed significantly between early systole, late systole, and diastasis (27.7 [20.8, 35.1]{$^\circ$} vs 45.2 [42.1, 49]{$^\circ$} vs 20.7 [16.6, 26.4]{$^\circ$}, p{$<$}0.001). Conclusion We demonstrate that it is possible to probe cardiomyocyte mobility using multi-phase and high resolution cDTI. In healthy volunteers, aggregate cardiomyocytes re-orient themselves more longitudinally during contraction, while cardiomyocyte sheetlets tilt radially during wall thickening. These observations provide new insights into the three-dimensional mobility of myocardial microstructure during systolic contraction.},

  abstract = {Spin-echo-based acquisitions are the workhorse of clinical MRI because they provide a variety of useful image contrasts and are resistant to image artifacts from radio-frequency or static field inhomogeneity. Three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions provide datasets that can be retrospectively reformatted for viewing in freely selectable orientations, and are thus advantageous for evaluating the complex anatomy associated with many clinical applications of MRI. Historically, however, 3D spin-echo-based acquisitions have not played a significant role in clinical MRI due to unacceptably long acquisition times or image artifacts associated with details of the acquisition method. Recently, optimized forms of 3D fast/turbo spin-echo imaging have become available from several MR-equipment manufacturers (for example, CUBE [GE], SPACE [Siemens], and VISTA [Philips]). Through specific design strategies and optimization, including short non--spatially selective radio-frequency pulses to significantly shorten the echo spacing and variable flip angles for the refocusing radio-frequency pulses to suppress blurring or considerably lengthen the useable duration of the spin-echo train, these techniques permit single-slab 3D imaging of sizeable volumes in clinically acceptable acquisition times. These optimized fast/turbo spin-echo pulse sequences provide a robust and flexible approach for 3D spin-echo-based imaging with a broad range of clinical applications. J. Magn. Reson.

  abstract = {Background Bright-blood lumen and black-blood vessel wall imaging are required for the comprehensive assessment of aortic disease. These images are usually acquired separately, resulting in long examinations and potential misregistration between images. Purpose To characterize the performance of an accelerated and respiratory motion-compensated three-dimensional (3D) cardiac MRI technique for simultaneous contrast-free aortic lumen and vessel wall imaging with an interleaved T2 and inversion recovery prepared sequence (iT2Prep-BOOST). Study Type Prospective. Population A total of 30 consecutive patients with aortopathy referred for a clinically indicated cardiac MRI examination (9 females, mean age {\textpm} standard deviation: 32 {\textpm} 12 years). Field Strength/Sequence 1.5-T; bright-blood MR angiography (diaphragmatic navigator-gated T2-prepared 3D balanced steady-state free precession [bSSFP], T2Prep-bSSFP), breath-held black-blood two-dimensional (2D) half acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE), and 3D bSSFP iT2Prep-BOOST. Assessment iT2Prep-BOOST bright-blood images were compared to T2prep-bSSFP images in terms of aortic vessel dimensions, lumen-to-myocardium contrast ratio (CR), and image quality (diagnostic confidence, vessel sharpness and presence of artifacts, assessed by three cardiologists on a 4-point scale, 1: nondiagnostic to 4: excellent). The iT2Prep-BOOST black-blood images were compared to 2D HASTE images for quantification of wall thickness. A visual comparison between computed tomography (CT) and iT2Prep-BOOST was performed in a patient with chronic aortic dissection. Statistical Tests Paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland--Altman analysis. A P value {$<$} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Bright-blood iT2Prep-BOOST resulted in significantly improved image quality (mean {\textpm} standard deviation 3.8 {\textpm} 0.5 vs. 3.3 {\textpm} 0.8) and CR (2.9 {\textpm} 0.8 vs. 1.8 {\textpm} 0.5) compared with T2Prep-bSSFP, with a shorter scan time (7.8 {\textpm} 1.7 minutes vs. 12.9 {\textpm} 3.4 minutes) while providing a complementary 3D black-blood image. Aortic lumen diameter and vessel wall thickness measurements in bright-blood and black-blood images were in good agreement with T2Prep-bSSFP and HASTE images ({$<$}0.02 cm and {$<$}0.005 cm bias, respectively) and good intrareader (ICC {$>$} 0.96) and interreader (ICC {$>$} 0.94) agreement was observed for all measurements. Data Conclusion iT2Prep-BOOST might enable time-efficient simultaneous bright- and black-blood aortic imaging, with improved image quality compared to T2Prep-bSSFP and HASTE imaging, and comparable measurements for aortic wall and lumen dimensions.

The reasons for limited access are technological, economic and social. With the advancement of MRI technology, we explore why these challenges still prevail, highlighting the importance of MRI as the epidemiology of disease changes in LMICs. In this paper, we establish a framework to develop MRI with these challenges in mind and discuss the different aspects of MRI development, including maximising image quality using cost-effective components, integrating local technology and infrastructure and implementing sustainable practices. We also highlight the current solutions---including teleradiology, artificial intelligence and doctor and patient education strategies---and how these might be further improved to achieve greater access to MRI.},

Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues. Addressing these complexities requires the integration of technologies from the fields of engineering, biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. 3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues, including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart tissue and cartilaginous structures.

Openly available and user friendly tools for the flexible generation of tailor-made datasets for the specific tasks at hand can greatly facilitate the work of researchers around the world. METHODS: We present an open-source framework, Fiberfox, that enables (1) the intuitive definition of arbitrary artificial white matter fiber tracts, (2) signal generation from those fibers by means of the most recent multi-compartment modeling techniques, and (3) simulation of the actual MR acquisition that allows for the introduction of realistic MRI-related effects into the final image. RESULTS: We show that real acquisitions can be closely approximated by simulating the acquisition of the well-known FiberCup phantom. We further demonstrate the advantages of our framework by evaluating the effects of imaging artifacts and acquisition settings on the outcome of 12 tractography algorithms. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that experiments on a realistic software phantom might change the conclusions drawn from earlier hardware phantom experiments. Fiberfox may find application in validating and further developing methods such as tractography, super-resolution, diffusion modeling or artifact correction.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to implement and optimize a novel application of diffusion-prepared balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) to perform in vivo cardiac diffusion-weighted MRI. THEORY AND METHODS: Diffusion-prepared sequences have the flexibility to diffusion encode with a multi-shot image readout. The diffusion preparation was optimized to reduce sensitivity to cardiac bulk motion with second order motion compensation (M1M2). The image readout consisted of a three-dimensional (3D) centric-encoded segmented bSSFP acquisition that incorporated a prospective navigator. Ten healthy subjects were scanned twice using the proposed technique diffusion preparation with and without M1M2 using three orthogonal directions under varying off-resonance conditions. Trace apparent diffusion coefficient (trADC) maps and the left ventricular (LV) trADC were calculated. RESULTS: M1M2 diffusion-prepared scans resulted in LV trADC values of 1.5 {\textpm} 0.4 {\texttimes} 10(-3) mm(2)/s that were reproducible yielding no statistical differences (P = 0.54). M1M2 diffusion-prepared images showed no ghosting artifacts and/or signal fallout. The non-motion-compensated diffusion-prepared scans yielded LV trADC values of 6.6 {\textpm} 0.9 {\texttimes} 10(-3) mm(2)/s and diffusion-prepared images with severe bulk motion-induced artifacts. CONCLUSION: We developed a novel free-breathing bulk motion compensated diffusion-prepared 3D segmented bSSFP technique able to perform in vivo cardiac diffusion-weighted MRI on a conventional clinical MR scanner.},

Diffusion tensor cardiac magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) may enable noninvasive interrogation of in~vivo cardiac microstructural dynamics. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition of abnormal myocardium with~unknown sheetlet function. Objectives This study sought to validate in~vivo DT-CMR measures of cardiac microstructure against histology, characterize microstructural dynamics during left ventricular wall thickening, and apply the technique in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and DCM. Methods In~vivo DT-CMR was acquired throughout the cardiac cycle in healthy swine, followed by in situ and~ex~vivo~DT-CMR, then validated against histology. In~vivo DT-CMR was performed in 19 control subjects, 19 DCM, and 13~HCM~patients. Results In swine, a DT-CMR index of sheetlet reorientation (E2A) changed substantially (E2A mobility {$\sim$}46{$^\circ$}). E2A changes correlated with wall thickness changes (in~vivo r2~= 0.75; in situ r2~= 0.89), were consistently observed under all experimental conditions, and accorded closely with histological analyses in both relaxed and contracted states. The potential contribution of cyclical strain effects to in~vivo E2A was {$\sim$}17\%. In healthy human control subjects, E2A increased from diastole (18{$^\circ$}) to systole (65{$^\circ$}; p~{$<$} 0.001; E2A mobility~= 45{$^\circ$}). HCM patients showed significantly greater E2A in diastole than control subjects did (48{$^\circ$}; p~{$<$} 0.001) with impaired E2A mobility (23{$^\circ$}; p~{$<$} 0.001). In DCM, E2A was similar to control subjects in diastole, but~systolic values were markedly lower (40{$^\circ$}; p~{$<$} 0.001) with impaired E2A mobility (20{$^\circ$}; p~{$<$} 0.001). Conclusions Myocardial microstructure dynamics can be characterized by in~vivo DT-CMR. Sheetlet function was abnormal in DCM with altered systolic conformation and reduced mobility, contrasting with HCM, which showed reduced~mobility with altered diastolic conformation. These novel insights significantly improve understanding of contractile dysfunction at a level of noninvasive interrogation not previously available in humans.},

  abstract = {The 3D microarchitecture of the cardiac muscle underlies the mechanical and electrical properties of the heart. Cardiomyocytes are arranged helically through the depth of the wall, and their shortening leads to macroscopic torsion, twist, and shortening during cardiac contraction. Furthermore, cardiomyocytes are organized in sheetlets separated by shear layers, which reorientate, slip, and shear during macroscopic left ventricle (LV) wall thickening. Cardiac diffusion provides a means for noninvasive interrogation of the 3D microarchitecture of the myocardium. The fundamental principle of MR diffusion is that an MRI signal is attenuated by the self-diffusion of water in the presence of large diffusion-encoding gradients. Since water molecules are constrained by the boundaries in biological tissue (cell membranes, collagen layers, etc.), depicting their diffusion behavior elucidates the shape of the myocardial microarchitecture they are embedded in. Cardiac diffusion therefore provides a noninvasive means to understand not only the dynamic changes in cardiac microstructure of healthy myocardium during cardiac contraction but also the pathophysiological changes in the presence of disease. This unique and innovative technology offers tremendous potential to enable improved clinical diagnosis through novel microstructural and functional assessment. in vivo cardiac diffusion methods are immediately translatable to patients, opening new avenues for diagnostic investigation and treatment evaluation in a range of clinically important cardiac pathologies. This review article describes the 3D microstructure of the LV, explains in vivo and ex vivo cardiac MR diffusion acquisition and postprocessing techniques, as well as clinical applications to date.

  abstract = {Imaging is an indispensable tool for brain tumour diagnosis, surgical planning, and follow-up. Definite diagnosis, however, often demands histopathological analysis of microscopic features of tissue samples, which have to be obtained by invasive means. A non-invasive alternative may be to probe corresponding microscopic tissue characteristics by MRI, or so called 'microstructure imaging'. The promise of microstructure imaging is one of 'virtual biopsy' with the goal to offset the need for invasive procedures in favour of imaging that can guide pre-surgical planning and can be repeated longitudinally to monitor and predict treatment response. The exploration of such methods is motivated by the striking link between parameters from MRI and tumour histology, for example the correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient and cellularity. Recent microstructure imaging techniques probe even more subtle and specific features, providing parameters associated to cell shape, size, permeability, and volume distributions. However, the range of scenarios in which these techniques provide reliable imaging biomarkers that can be used to test medical hypotheses or support clinical decisions is yet unknown. Accurate microstructure imaging may moreover require acquisitions that go beyond conventional data acquisition strategies. This review covers a wide range of candidate microstructure imaging methods based on diffusion MRI and relaxometry, and explores advantages, challenges, and potential pitfalls in brain tumour microstructure imaging.},

A unique feature of our technique is its formulation of linear recurrences as matrix computations, before exploiting their mathematical properties for more compact representations. Based on a general notion of closure for matrix multiplication, we present two classes of matrices that have compact representations. These classes are permutation matrices and matrices whose elements are linearly related to each other. To validate the proposed method, we experiment with solving recurrences whose matrices have compact representations using CUDA on nVidia GeForce 8800 GTX GPU. The advantages of our technique are that it enables the computation of larger recurrences in parallel and it provides good speedups of up to eleven times over the un-optimized parallel computations. Also, the memory usage can be as much as nine times lower than that of the un-optimized parallel computations. Our result confirms a promising approach for the adoption of more advanced parallelization techniques.},

  abstract = {Natural image statistics indicate that we should use nonconvex norms for most regularization tasks in image processing and computer vision. Still, they are rarely used in practice due to the challenge of optimization. Recently, iteratively reweighed \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ minimization (IRL1) has been proposed as a way to tackle a class of nonconvex functions by solving a sequence of convex \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$-\${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ problems. We extend the problem class to the sum of a convex function and a (nonconvex) nondecreasing function applied to another convex function. The proposed algorithm sequentially optimizes suitably constructed convex majorizers. Convergence to a critical point is proved when the Kurdyka--{\L}ojasiewicz property and additional mild restrictions hold for the objective function. The efficiency and practical importance of the algorithm are demonstrated in computer vision tasks such as image denoising and optical flow. Most applications seek smooth results with sharp discontinuities. These are achieved by combining nonconvexity with higher order regularization.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to identify the minimum requirements for an accurate model of the diffusion MR signal in white matter of the brain. We construct a taxonomy of multi-compartment models of white matter from combinations of simple models for the intra- and the extra-axonal spaces. We devise a new diffusion MRI protocol that provides measurements with a wide range of imaging parameters for diffusion sensitization both parallel and perpendicular to white matter fibres. We use the protocol to acquire data from two fixed rat brains, which allows us to fit, study and compare the different models. The study examines a total of 47 analytic models, including several well-used models from the literature, which we place within the taxonomy. The results show that models that incorporate intra-axonal restriction, such as ball and stick or CHARMED, generally explain the data better than those that do not, such as the DT or the biexponential models. However, three-compartment models which account for restriction parallel to the axons and incorporate pore size explain the measurements most accurately. The best fit comes from combining a full diffusion tensor (DT) model of the extra-axonal space with a cylindrical intra-axonal component of single radius and a third spherical compartment of non-zero radius. We also measure the stability of the non-zero radius intra-axonal models and find that single radius intra-axonal models are more stable than gamma distributed radii models with similar fitting performance.},

  abstract = {Recent work in the development of computerized phantoms has focused on the creation of ideal ``hybrid'' models that seek to combine the realism of a patient-based voxelized phantom with the flexibility of a mathematical or stylized phantom. We have been leading the development of such computerized phantoms for use in medical imaging research. This paper will summarize our developments dating from the original four-dimensional (4-D) Mathematical Cardiac-Torso (MCAT) phantom, a stylized model based on geometric primitives, to the current 4-D extended Cardiac-Torso (XCAT) and Mouse Whole-Body (MOBY) phantoms, hybrid models of the human and laboratory mouse based on state-of-the-art computer graphics techniques. This paper illustrates the evolution of computerized phantoms toward more accurate models of anatomy and physiology. This evolution was catalyzed through the introduction of nonuniform rational b-spline (NURBS) and subdivision (SD) surfaces, tools widely used in computer graphics, as modeling primitives to define a more ideal hybrid phantom. With NURBS and SD surfaces as a basis, we progressed from a simple geometrically based model of the male torso (MCAT) containing only a handful of structures to detailed, whole-body models of the male and female (XCAT) anatomies (at different ages from newborn to adult), each containing more than 9000 structures. The techniques we applied for modeling the human body were similarly used in the creation of the 4-D MOBY phantom, a whole-body model for the mouse designed for small animal imaging research. From our work, we have found the NURBS and SD surface modeling techniques to be an efficient and flexible way to describe the anatomy and physiology for realistic phantoms. Based on imaging data, the surfaces can accurately model the complex organs and structures in the body, providing a level of realism comparable to that of a voxelized phantom. In addition, they are very flexible. Like stylized models, they can easily be manipulated to model anatomical variations and patient motion. With the vast improvement in realism, the phantoms developed in our lab can be combined with accurate models of the imaging process (SPECT, PET, CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound) to generate simulated imaging data close to that from actual human or animal subjects. As such, they can provide vital tools to generate predictive imaging data from many different subjects under various scanning parameters from which to quantitatively evaluate and improve imaging devices and techniques. From the MCAT to XCAT, we will demonstrate how NURBS and SD surface modeling have resulted in a major evolutionary advance in the development of computerized phantoms for imaging research.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To present a novel Optimized Diffusion-weighting Gradient waveform Design (ODGD) method for the design of minimum echo time (TE), bulk motion-compensated, and concomitant gradient (CG)-nulling waveforms for diffusion MRI. Methods: ODGD motion-compensated waveforms were designed for various moment-nullings Mn (n=0,1,2), for a range of b-values, and spatial resolutions, both without (ODGD-Mn) and with CG-nulling (ODGD-Mn-CG). Phantom and in-vivo (brain and liver) experiments were conducted with various ODGD waveforms to compare motion robustness, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps with state-of-the-art waveforms. Results: ODGD-Mn and ODGD-Mn-CG waveforms reduced the TE of state-of-the-art waveforms. This TE reduction resulted in significantly higher SNR (P {$<$} 0.05) in both phantom and in-vivo experiments. ODGD-M1 improved the SNR of BIPOLAR (42.8{\textpm}5.3 versus 32.9{\textpm}3.3) in the brain, and ODGD-M2 the SNR of motion-compensated (MOCO) and Convex Optimized Diffusion Encoding-M2 (CODE-M2) (12.3{\textpm}3.6 versus 9.7{\textpm}2.9 and 10.2{\textpm}3.4, respectively) in the liver. Further, ODGD-M2 also showed excellent motion robustness in the liver. ODGD-Mn-CG waveforms reduced the CG-related dephasing effects of non CG-nulling waveforms in phantom and in-vivo experiments, resulting in accurate ADC maps. Conclusions: ODGD waveforms enable motion-robust diffusion MRI with reduced TEs, increased SNR, and reduced ADC bias compared to state-of-the-art waveforms in theoretical results, simulations, phantoms and in-vivo experiments.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Free-breathing whole-heart coronary MR angiography (MRA) commonly uses navigators to gate respiratory motion, resulting in lengthy and unpredictable acquisition times. Conversely, self-navigation has 100\% scan efficiency, but requires motion correction over a broad range of respiratory displacements, which may introduce image artifacts. We propose replacing navigators and self-navigation with a respiratory motion-resolved reconstruction approach. METHODS: Using a respiratory signal extracted directly from the imaging data, individual signal-readouts are binned according to their respiratory states. The resultant series of undersampled images are reconstructed using an extradimensional golden-angle radial sparse parallel imaging (XD-GRASP) algorithm, which exploits sparsity along the respiratory dimension. Whole-heart coronary MRA was performed in 11 volunteers and four patients with the proposed methodology. Image quality was compared with that obtained with one-dimensional respiratory self-navigation. RESULTS: Respiratory-resolved reconstruction effectively suppressed respiratory motion artifacts. The quality score for XD-GRASP reconstructions was greater than or equal to self-navigation in 80/88 coronary segments, reaching diagnostic quality in 61/88 segments versus 41/88. Coronary sharpness and length were always superior for the respiratory-resolved datasets, reaching statistical significance (P {$<$} 0.05) in most cases. CONCLUSION: XD-GRASP represents an attractive alternative for handling respiratory motion in free-breathing whole heart MRI and provides an effective alternative to self-navigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Written informed consent was obtained from all participants for this institutional review board-approved study. Self-navigated coronary MR angiography was performed after administration of a contrast agent in 78 patients (mean age, 48.5 years {\textpm} 20.7 [standard deviation]; 53 male patients) referred for cardiac MR imaging because of coronary artery disease (n = 40), cardiomyopathy (n = 14), congenital anomaly (n = 17), or "other" (n = 7). Examination duration was recorded, and the image quality for each coronary segment was assessed with consensus reading. Vessel sharpness, length, and diameter were measured. Quantitative values in proximal, middle, and distal segments were compared by using analysis of variance and t tests. A double-blinded comparison with the results of x-ray angiography was performed when such results were available. RESULTS: When patients with different indications for cardiac MR imaging were examined with self-navigated postcontrast coronary MR angiography, whole-heart data sets with 1.15-mm isotropic spatial resolution were acquired in an average of 7.38 minutes {\textpm} 1.85. The main and proximal coronary segments could be visualized in 92.3\% of cases, while the middle and distal segments could be visualized in 84.0\% and 55.8\% of cases, respectively. Subjective scores and vessel sharpness were significantly higher in the proximal segments than in the middle and distal segments (P {$<$} .05). Anomalies of the coronary arteries could be confirmed or excluded in all cases. Per-vessel sensitivity and specificity for stenosis detection were 64.7\% and 85.0\%, respectively, in the 31 patients for whom reference standard x-ray coronary angiography results were available. CONCLUSION: The self-navigated coronary MR angiography sequence shows promise for coronary imaging. However, technical improvements are needed to improve image quality, especially in the more distal coronary segments.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop an efficient 3D affine respiratory motion compensation framework for Cartesian whole-heart coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Materials and Methods The proposed method achieves 100\% scan efficiency by estimating the affine respiratory motion from the data itself and correcting the acquired data in the reconstruction process. For this, a golden-step Cartesian sampling with spiral profile ordering was performed to enable reconstruction of respiratory resolved images at any breathing position and with different respiratory window size. Affine motion parameters were estimated from image-based registration of 3D undersampled respiratory resolved images reconstructed with iterative SENSE and motion correction was performed directly in the reconstruction using a multiple-coils generalized matrix formulation method. This approach was tested on healthy volunteers and compared against a conventional diaphragmatic navigator-gated acquisition using quantitative and qualitative image quality assessment. Results The proposed approach achieved 47 {\textpm} 12\% and 59 {\textpm} 6\% vessel sharpness for the right (RCA) and left (LAD) coronary arteries, respectively. Also, good quality visual scores of 2.4 {\textpm} 0.74 and 2.44 {\textpm} 0.86 were observed for the RCA and LAD (scores from 0, no to 4, excellent coronary vessel delineation). A not statically significant difference (P = 0.05) was found between the proposed method and an 8-mm navigator-gated and tracked scan, although scan efficiency increased from 61 {\textpm} 10\% to 100\%. Conclusion We demonstrate the feasibility of a new 3D affine respiratory motion correction technique for Cartesian whole-heart CMRA that achieves 100\% scan efficiency and therefore a predictable acquisition time. This approach yields image quality comparable to that of an 8-mm navigator-gated acquisition with lower scan efficiency. Further evaluation of this technique in patients is now warranted to determine its clinical use. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:738--746. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In the developed world, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a well-established non-invasive imaging modality in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. However, there is significant global inequality in availability and access to CMR due to its high cost, technical demands as well as existing disparities in healthcare and technical infrastructures across high-income and low-income countries. Recent renewed interest in low-field CMR has been spurred by the clinical need to provide sustainable imaging technology capable of yielding diagnosticquality images whilst also being tailored to the local populations and healthcare ecosystems. This review aims to evaluate the technical, practical and cost considerations of low field CMR whilst also exploring the key barriers to implementing sustainable MRI in both the developing and developed world.},

  abstract = {Cardiac MRI plays an important role in the evaluation of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, congenital disease, pericardial disease, and masses. Large multicenter trials have shown the positive impact of MRI-based management on outcomes in several CVDs. These results have made MRI an indispensable technique in the evaluation of these diseases, and cardiac MRI has an important role in multisociety guidelines. MRI is the reference standard for quantification of ventricular volumes and function. Flow imaging enables accurate quantification of flow and velocities through valves, shunts, and surgical conduits or baffles. Late gadolinium enhancement and parametric mapping techniques enable tissue characterization and yield prognostic information. In the past decade, cardiac MRI technology has seen rapid advances in both hardware and sequences. Multiple novel sequences, such as parametric mapping and four-dimensional flow, are increasingly being incorporated into routine clinical practice. Acceleration strategies have matured, allowing faster acquisition of cardiac MRI sequences in patients with arrhythmia and poor breath holding. Challenges of cardiac MRI at high-field-strength magnets and in patients with indwelling cardiac devices or severe renal dysfunction have been mitigated. Artificial intelligence techniques are decreasing the complexity of MRI acquisition and postprocessing.

  abstract = {Many closed-form analytical models have been proposed to relate the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) signal to microstructural features of white matter tissues. These models generally make assumptions about the tissue and the diffusion processes which often depart from the biophysical reality, limiting their reliability and interpretability in practice. Monte Carlo simulations of the random walk of water molecules are widely recognized to provide near groundtruth for DW-MRI signals. However, they have mostly been limited to the validation of simpler models rather than used for the estimation of microstructural properties. This work proposes a general framework which leverages Monte Carlo simulations for the estimation of physically interpretable microstructural parameters, both in single and in crossing fascicles of axons. Monte Carlo simulations of DW-MRI signals, or fingerprints, are pre-computed for a large collection of microstructural configurations. At every voxel, the microstructural parameters are estimated by optimizing a sparse combination of these fingerprints. Extensive synthetic experiments showed that our approach achieves accurate and robust estimates in the presence of noise and uncertainties over fixed or input parameters. In an in vivo rat model of spinal cord injury, our approach provided microstructural parameters that showed better correspondence with histology than five closed-form models of the diffusion signal: MMWMD, NODDI, DIAMOND, WMTI and MAPL. On whole-brain in vivo data from the human connectome project (HCP), our method exhibited spatial distributions of apparent axonal radius and axonal density indices in keeping with ex vivo studies. This work paves the way for microstructure fingerprinting with Monte Carlo simulations used directly at the modeling stage and not only as a validation tool.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the cardiac motion artifact that regularly appears in diffusion-weighted imaging of the left liver lobe might be reduced by acquiring images in inspiration, when the coupling between heart and liver might be minimal. Materials and methods 43 patients with known or suspected focal liver lesions were examined at 1.5 T with breath hold acquisition, once in inspiration and once in expiration. Data were acquired with a diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence and two b-values (b50 = 50 s/mm{$^2$} and b800 = 800 s/mm{$^2$}). The severity of the cardiac motion artifact in the left liver lobe was rated by two experienced radiologists for both b-values with a 5 point Likert scale. Additionally, the normalized signal S(b800)/S(b50) in the left liver lobe was computed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used comparing the scores of the two readers obtained in inspiration and expiration, and to compare the normalized signal in inspiration and expiration. Results The normalized signal in inspiration was slightly higher than in expiration (0.349{\textpm}0.077 vs 0.336{\textpm}0.058), which would indicate a slight reduction of the cardiac motion artifact, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.24). In the qualitative evaluation, the readers did not observe a significant difference for b50 (reader 1: p = 0.61; reader 2: p = 0.18). For b800, reader 1 observed a significant difference of small effect size favouring expiration (p = 0.03 with a difference of mean Likert scores of 0.27), while reader 2 observed no significant difference (p = 0.62). Conclusion Acquiring the data in inspiration does not lead to a markedly reduced cardiac motion artifact in diffusion-weighted imaging of the left liver lobe and is in this regard not to be preferred over acquiring the data in expiration.},

  abstract = {Purpose Quantitative mapping of the native T1 of the heart using the modified look-locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) technique provides high quality diagnostic information without requiring contrast agents. Previous work has considered the effects of T2 relaxation on MOLLI T1 measurements, finding that the T1 measured by MOLLI is biased, and that Saturation-recovery single-Shot Acquisition generates a more precise T1. However, despite detailed experiments and simulation the exact relaxation times observed in vivo remain unexplained, but might be due to magnetization transfer (MT). Methods We used an MT simulation based on the Bloch-McConnell equations to evaluate the most common MOLLI and saturation-recovery single-shot acquisition sequence variants. Results For myocardial tissue we find that the T1 measured by saturation-recovery single-shot acquisition is insensitive to MT and T2, whereas MT reduces the T1 measured by MOLLI ({$>$}10\%) in addition to the effects due to T2 relaxation. Conclusions The consequences of this T1 underestimation by MOLLI are relevant. Increases in the actual T1 and T2 and decreases in MT will all result in an increase in T1 measured by MOLLI. Myocardial infarction demonstrates increased native T1 and T2 and decreased MT, indicating that these biases enhance the sensitivity of MOLLI to detect this and possibly other cardiovascular disease states.

  abstract = {Purpose To develop histology-informed simulations of diffusion tensor cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) for typical in-vivo pulse sequences and determine their sensitivity to changes in extra-cellular space (ECS) and other microstructural parameters. Methods We synthesised the DT-CMR signal from Monte Carlo random walk simulations. The virtual tissue was based on porcine histology. The cells were thickened and then shrunk to modify ECS. We also created idealised geometries using cuboids in regular arrangement, matching the extra-cellular volume fraction (ECV) of 16--40\%. The simulated voxel size was 2.8 {\texttimes} 2.8 {\texttimes} 8.0 mm3 for pulse sequences covering short and long diffusion times: Stejskal--Tanner pulsed-gradient spin echo, second-order motion-compensated spin echo, and stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM), with clinically available gradient strengths. Results The primary diffusion tensor eigenvalue increases linearly with ECV at a similar rate for all simulated geometries. Mean diffusivity (MD) varies linearly, too, but is higher for the substrates with more uniformly distributed ECS. Fractional anisotropy (FA) for the histology-based geometry is higher than the idealised geometry with low sensitivity to ECV, except for the long mixing time of the STEAM sequence. Varying the intra-cellular diffusivity (DIC) results in large changes of MD and FA. Varying extra-cellular diffusivity or using stronger gradients has minor effects on FA. Uncertainties of the primary eigenvector orientation are reduced using STEAM. Conclusions We found that the distribution of ECS has a measurable impact on DT-CMR parameters. The observed sensitivity of MD and FA to ECV and DIC has potentially interesting applications for interpreting in-vivo DT-CMR parameters.},

  abstract = {Purpose To compare accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of four commonly used myocardial T1 mapping sequences: modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI), shortened MOLLI (ShMOLLI), saturation recovery single-shot acquisition (SASHA), and saturation pulse prepared heart rate independent inversion recovery (SAPPHIRE). Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. All subjects provided written informed consent. Accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the four T1 mapping sequences were first compared in phantom experiments. In vivo analysis was performed in seven healthy subjects (mean age {\textpm} standard deviation, 38 years {\textpm} 19; four men, three women) who were imaged twice on two separate days. In vivo reproducibility of native T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) were measured. Differences between the sequences were assessed by using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests (phantom data) and mixed-effect models (in vivo data). Results T1 mapping accuracy in phantoms was lower with ShMOLLI (62 msec) and MOLLI (44 msec) than with SASHA (13 msec; P {$<$} .05) and SAPPHIRE (12 msec; P {$<$} .05). MOLLI had similar precision to ShMOLLI (4.0 msec vs 5.6 msec; P = .07) but higher precision than SAPPHIRE (6.8 msec; P = .002) and SASHA (8.7 msec; P {$<$} .001). All sequences had similar reproducibility in phantoms (P = .1). The four sequences had similar in vivo reproducibility for native T1 mapping ({$\sim$}25--50 msec; P {$>$} .05) and ECV quantification ({$\sim$}0.01--0.02; P {$>$} .05). Conclusion SASHA and SAPPHIRE yield higher accuracy, lower precision, and similar reproducibility compared with MOLLI and ShMOLLI for T1 measurement. Different sequences yield different ECV values; however, all sequences have similar reproducibility for ECV quantification. {\copyright} RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

While existing works focus on CT scans, this paper studies the application of DL techniques for the analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) images. Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, video-level, and pixel-level (segmentation masks). Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images. In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way. Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level. Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data.},

  abstract = {A novel method for amplitude of radiofrequency field (B1+) mapping based on the Bloch-Siegert shift is presented. Unlike conventionally applied double-angle or other signal magnitude-based methods, it encodes the B(1) information into signal phase, resulting in important advantages in terms of acquisition speed, accuracy, and robustness. The Bloch-Siegert frequency shift is caused by irradiating with an off-resonance radiofrequency pulse following conventional spin excitation. When applying the off-resonance radiofrequency in the kilohertz range, spin nutation can be neglected and the primarily observed effect is a spin precession frequency shift. This shift is proportional to the square of the magnitude of B1(2). Adding gradient image encoding following the off-resonance pulse allows one to acquire spatially resolved B(1) maps. The frequency shift from the Bloch-Siegert effect gives a phase shift in the image that is proportional to B(1)(2). The phase difference of two acquisitions, with the radiofrequency pulse applied at two frequencies symmetrically around the water resonance, is used to eliminate undesired off-resonance effects due to amplitude of static field inhomogeneity and chemical shift. In vivo Bloch-Siegert B(1) mapping with 25 sec/slice is demonstrated to be quantitatively comparable to a 21-min double-angle map. As such, this method enables robust, high-resolution B(1)(+) mapping in a clinically acceptable time frame.},

  abstract = {The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.},

We evaluated whether prenatal cardiovascular changes previously demonstrated in FGR persist into preadolescence.Methods and Results---A cohort study of 58 FGR (defined as birth weight below 10th centile) and 94 normally grown fetuses identified in utero and followed-up into preadolescence (8--12 years of age) by echocardiography and 3-dimensional shape computational analysis. Compared with controls, FGR preadolescents had a different cardiac shape, with more spherical and smaller hearts. Left ventricular ejection fraction was similar among groups, whereas FGR had decreased longitudinal motion (decreased mitral annular systolic peak velocities: control median, 0.11 m/s [interquartile range, 0.09--0.12] versus FGR median 0.09 m/s [interquartile range, 0.09--0.10]; P{$<$}0.01) and impaired relaxation (isovolumic relaxation time: control, 0.21 ms [interquartile range, 0.12--0.35] versus FGR, 0.35 ms [interquartile range, 0.20--0.46]; P=0.04). Global longitudinal strain was decreased (control mean, -22.4\% [SD, 1.37] versus FGR mean, -21.5\% [SD, 1.16]; P{$<$}0.001) compensated by an increased circumferential strain and with a higher prevalence of postsystolic shortening in FGR as compared with controls. These differences persisted after adjustment for parental ethnicity and smoking, prenatal glucocorticoid administration, preeclampsia, gestational age at delivery, days in intensive care unit, sex, age, and body surface area at evaluation.Conclusions---This study provides evidence that cardiac remodeling induced by FGR persists until preadolescence with findings similar to those reported in their prenatal life and childhood. The findings support the hypothesis of primary cardiac programming in FGR for explaining the association between low birth weight and cardiovascular risk in adulthood.},

  abstract = {Background Myocardial extravascular extracellular volume fraction (Ve) measures quantify diffuse fibrosis not readily detectable by conventional late gadolinium (Gd) enhancement (LGE). Ve measurement requires steady state equilibrium between plasma and interstitial Gd contrast. While a constant infusion produces steady state, it is unclear whether a simple bolus can do the same. Given the relatively slow clearance of Gd, we hypothesized that a bolus technique accurately measures Ve, thus facilitating integration of myocardial fibrosis quantification into cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) workflow routines. Assuming equivalence between techniques, we further hypothesized that Ve measures would be reproducible across scans. Methods In 10 volunteers (ages 20-81, median 33 yr, 3 females), we compared serial Ve measures from a single short axis slice from two scans: first, during a constant infusion, and second, 12-50 min after a bolus (0.2 mmol/kg gadoteridol) on another day. Steady state during infusion was defined when serial blood and myocardial T1 data varied {$<$}5\%. We measured T1 on a 1.5 T Siemens scanner using a single-shot modified Look Locker inversion recovery sequence (MOLLI) with balanced SSFP. To shorten breath hold times, T1 values were measured with a shorter sampling scheme that was validated with spin echo relaxometry (TR = 15 sec) in CuSO4-Agar phantoms. Serial infusion vs. bolus Ve measures (n = 205) from the 10 subjects were compared with generalized estimating equations (GEE) with exchangeable correlation matrices. LGE images were also acquired 12-30 minutes after the bolus. Results No subject exhibited LGE near the short axis slices where Ve was measured. The Ve range was 19.3-29.2\% and 18.4-29.1\% by constant infusion and bolus, respectively. In GEE models, serial Ve measures by constant infusion and bolus did not differ significantly (difference = 0.1\%, p = 0.38). For both techniques, Ve was strongly related to age (p {$<$} 0.01 for both) in GEE models, even after adjusting for heart rate. Both techniques identically sorted older individuals with higher mean Ve values. Conclusion Myocardial Ve can be measured reliably and accurately 12-50 minutes after a simple bolus. Ve measures are also reproducible across CMR scans. Ve estimation can be integrated into CMR workflow easily, which may simplify research applications involving the quantification of myocardial fibrosis.},

  abstract = {While cardiovascular magnetic resonance (MR) has become the noninvasive tool of choice for the assessment of myocardial viability and for the detection of acute myocardial edema, cardiac T1 mapping is believed to further extend the ability of cardiovascular MR to characterize the myocardium. Fundamentally, cardiovascular MR can improve diagnosis of disease that historically has been challenging to establish with other imaging modalities. For example, decreased native T1 values appear highly specific to detect and quantify disease severity related to myocardial iron overload states or glycosphingolipid accumulation in Anderson-Fabry disease, whereas high native T1 values are observed with edema, amyloid, and other conditions. Cardiovascular MR can also improve the assessment of prognosis with parameters that relate to myocardial structure and composition that complement the familiar functional parameters around which contemporary cardiology decision making revolves. In large cohorts, extracellular volume fraction (ECV) has been shown to quantify the full extent of myocardial fibrosis in noninfarcted myocardium. ECV may predict outcomes at least as effectively as left ventricular ejection fraction. This uncommon statistical observation (of potentially being more strongly associated with outcomes than ejection fraction) suggests prime biologic importance for the cardiac interstitium that may rank highly in the hierarchy of vast myocardial changes occurring in cardiac pathophysiology. This article presents current and developing clinical applications of cardiac T1 mapping and reviews the existing evidence on their diagnostic and prognostic value in various clinical conditions. This article also contextualizes these advances and explores how T1 mapping and ECV may affect major "global" issues such as diagnosis of disease, risk stratification, and paradigms of disease, and ultimately how we conceptualize patient vulnerability.},

The technique is based on the variable-prephasing (VP) method, but takes into account the effects of all gradients involved in the measurement. Methods We conducted measurements of a trapezoidal test gradient and of an EPI readout gradient train with three approaches: VP, CVP, and fully compensated variable-prephasing (FCVP). We compared them to one another and to predictions based on the gradient system transfer function. Furthermore, we used the measured and predicted EPI gradients for trajectory corrections in phantom images on a 7 T scanner. Results The VP gradient measurements are confounded by lingering oscillations of the prephasing gradients, which are compensated in the CVP and FCVP measurements. FCVP is vulnerable to a sign asymmetry in the gradient chain. However, the trajectories determined by all three methods resulted in comparably high EPI image quality. Conclusion We present a new approach allowing for phantom-based gradient waveform measurements with high precision, which can be useful for trajectory corrections in non-Cartesian or single-shot imaging techniques. In our experimental setup, the proposed ``compensated variable-prephasing'' method provided the most reliable gradient measurements of the different techniques we compared.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Postmortem MRI can be used to reveal important pathologies and establish radiology-pathology correlations. However, quantitative MRI values are altered by tissue fixation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate time-dependent effects of formalin fixation on MRI relaxometry (T1 and T2), diffusion tensor imaging (fractional anisotropy, FA; and mean diffusivity, MD), and myelin water fraction (MWF) measurements throughout intact human brain specimens. Methods: Two whole, neurologically-healthy human brains were immersed in 10\% formalin solution and scanned at 13 time-points between 0 and 1032 hours. Whole brain maps of longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times, FA, MD, and MWF were generated at each time-point to illustrate spatiotemporal changes, and region-of-interest analyses were then performed in eight brain structures to quantify temporal changes with progressive fixation. Results: Although neither of the diffusion measures (FA nor MD) showed significant changes as a function of formalin fixation time, both T1 and T2-relaxation times significantly decreased, and MWF estimates significantly increased with progressive fixation until (and likely beyond) our final measurements were taken at 1032 hours. Conclusions: These results suggest that T1-relaxation, T2-relaxation and MWF estimates must be performed quite early in the fixation process to avoid formalin-induced changes compared to in vivo values; and furthermore, that different ex vivo scans within an experiment must be acquired at consistent (albeit still early) fixation intervals to avoid fixative-related differences between samples. Conversely, ex vivo diffusion measures (FA and MD) appear to depend more on other factors (e.g., pulse sequence optimization, sample temperature, etc.).},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a T2-magnetization preparation scheme for improving coronary artery imaging with true fast imaging with steady-state precession (True-FISP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulations were performed to compare the blood-myocardium signal difference with no T2-preparation to that with various T2-preparation times (24, 40, and 60 msec) using an electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered, segmented True-FISP acquisition. Seven volunteers were imaged to evaluate the effectiveness of T2-preparation for coronary artery delineation using True- FISP and to optimize the T2-preparation time. RESULTS: Simulations showed that T2-preparation improved the signal difference between blood and myocardium over that without T2-preparation. The optimal T2- preparation time was determined to be 40 msec. In volunteer studies, a T2- preparation time of 40 msec provided a significant improvement in contrast- to-noise ratio (CNR) between the coronary arteries and myocardium over that without T2-preparation. It also showed a significant improvement in visualizing the distal portions of the coronary arteries. CONCLUSION: T2-preparation improves coronary artery delineation with True-FISP.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an established non-invasive tool for the assessment of cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of death globally. CMR provides dynamic and static multi-contrast and multi-parametric images, including cine for functional evaluation, contrast-enhanced imaging and parametric mapping for tissue characterization, and MR angiography for the assessment of the aortic, coronary and pulmonary circulation. However, clinical CMR imaging sequences still have some limitations such as the requirement for multiple breath-holds, incomplete spatial coverage, complex planning and acquisition, low scan efficiency and long scan times. To address these challenges, novel techniques have been developed during the last two decades, focusing on automated planning and acquisition timing, improved respiratory and cardiac motion handling strategies, image acceleration algorithms employing undersampled reconstruction, all-in-one imaging techniques that can acquire multiple contrast/parameters in a single scan, deep learning based methods applied along the entire CMR imaging pipeline, as well as imaging at high- and low-field strengths. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of CMR imaging, covering both established and emerging techniques, to give an overview of the present and future applications of CMR.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop and validate a highly efficient motion compensated free-breathing isotropic resolution 3D whole-heart joint T1/T2 mapping sequence with anatomical water/fat imaging at 0.55 T. Methods The proposed sequence takes advantage of shorter T1 at 0.55 T to acquire three interleaved water/fat volumes with inversion-recovery preparation, no preparation, and T2 preparation, respectively. Image navigators were used to facilitate nonrigid motion-compensated image reconstruction. T1 and T2 maps were jointly calculated by a dictionary matching method. Validations were performed with simulation, phantom, and in vivo experiments on 10 healthy volunteers and 1 patient. The performance of the proposed sequence was compared with conventional 2D mapping sequences including modified Look-Locker inversion recovery and T2-prepared balanced steady-SSFP sequence. Results The proposed sequence has a good T1 and T2 encoding sensitivity in simulation, and excellent agreement with spin-echo reference T1 and T2 values was observed in a standardized T1/T2 phantom (R2 = 0.99). In vivo experiments provided good-quality co-registered 3D whole-heart T1 and T2 maps with 2-mm isotropic resolution in a short scan time of about 7 min. For healthy volunteers, left-ventricle T1 mean and SD measured by the proposed sequence were both comparable with those of modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (640 {\textpm} 35 vs. 630 {\textpm} 25 ms [p = 0.44] and 49.9 {\textpm} 9.3 vs. 54.4 {\textpm} 20.5 ms [p = 0.42]), whereas left-ventricle T2 mean and SD measured by the proposed sequence were both slightly lower than those of T2-prepared balanced SSFP (53.8 {\textpm} 5.5 vs. 58.6 {\textpm} 3.3 ms [p {$<$} 0.01] and 5.2 {\textpm} 0.9 vs. 6.1 {\textpm} 0.8 ms [p = 0.03]). Myocardial T1 and T2 in the patient measured by the proposed sequence were in good agreement with conventional 2D sequences and late gadolinium enhancement. Conclusion The proposed sequence simultaneously acquires 3D whole-heart T1 and T2 mapping with anatomical water/fat imaging at 0.55 T in a fast and efficient 7-min scan. Further investigation in patients with cardiovascular disease is now warranted.},

  abstract = {The relationship between magnetic field gradient waveform moments and the motion sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging was explored analytically and by computer simulation. The analysis and simulations revealed several key points. In general, waveform time moments define sensitivity to the time derivatives of position of moving material only at a single time point: the time about which the moments are computed. A Taylor series description of instantaneous position is expanded about this same time point to compute the phase acquired due to specific derivatives of position. A moment is proportional to phase sensitivity to a particular derivative of position throughout the waveform only when sensitivity to all lower-order derivatives is zero. Under restricted conditions of waveform symmetry and motion characteristics, the phase due to motion may be expressed in terms of the average value of a derivative of position over the duration of the waveform. The choice of the moment center, or point of expansion, adds a degree of freedom that may be used advantageously in the design of motion-compensating and motion phase-encoding gradient waveforms. These results facilitate a more complete understanding of the effects of motion through a magnetic field gradient.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce a new toolkit for simulation and processing of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data, and to demonstrate some of its novel features. METHODS: The FID appliance (FID-A) is an open-source, MATLAB-based software toolkit for simulation and processing of MRS data. The software is designed specifically for processing data with multiple dimensions (eg, multiple radiofrequency channels, averages, spectral editing dimensions). It is equipped with functions for importing data in the formats of most major MRI vendors (eg, Siemens, Philips, GE, Agilent) and for exporting data into the formats of several common processing software packages (eg, LCModel, jMRUI, Tarquin). This paper introduces the FID-A software toolkit and uses examples to demonstrate its novel features, namely 1) the use of a spectral registration algorithm to carry out useful processing routines automatically, 2) automatic detection and removal of motion-corrupted scans, and 3) the ability to perform several major aspects of the MRS computational workflow from a single piece of software. This latter feature is illustrated through both high-level processing of in vivo GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS MRS data, as well as detailed quantum mechanical simulations to generate an accurate LCModel basis set for analysis of the same data. RESULTS: All of the described processing steps resulted in a marked improvement in spectral quality compared with unprocessed data. Fitting of MEGA-PRESS data using a customized basis set resulted in improved fitting accuracy compared with a generic MEGA-PRESS basis set. CONCLUSIONS: The FID-A software toolkit enables high-level processing of MRS data and accurate simulation of in vivo MRS experiments.

  abstract = {Purpose Mapping intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) in the heart remains challenging despite advances in cardiac DWI and DTI. In the present work, simulations and experimental imaging are used to compare the IVIM encoding efficiency of spin-echo-- and stimulated-echo--based DWI/DTI for assessing myocardial perfusion. Methods Using normalized phase distributions and statistical models of capillary networks derived from histological studies, along with typical diffusion gradient waveforms for in vivo cardiac DWI/DTI, Monte Carlo simulations were performed. The simulation results were compared to IVIM measurements of perfused porcine hearts regarding both magnitude and phase modulation. An IVIM tensor model was used to account for anisotropy of the capillary network, and potential bias of parameter estimation was reported based on simulations. Results Both computer simulations and experimental data demonstrate a low sensitivity of spin-echo DWI/DTI sequences for IVIM parameters, whereas stimulated-echo--based DWI/DTI with typical mixing times can differentiate between no-flow baseline and perfused myocardium (+129\% IVIM-derived flow). In addition, ischemic territories induced by coronary occlusion could be successfully detected. With increasing order of motion compensation (M0/M1/M2) of the diffusion encoding gradients, as required for cardiac in vivo spin-echo DWI/DTI, the low IVIM sensitivity of spin-echo DWI/DTI decreased further in simulations: maximum attenuations of perfusion compartment 52/13/5\% (b = 500 s/mm2). Conclusion Given the short encoding time of spin-echo--based DWI/DTI sequences, a limited perfusion sensitivity results, in particular in combination with motion-compensated diffusion gradients. In contrast, stimulated-echo based DWI/DTI has the potential to identify perfusion changes in cardiac IVIM in vivo.},

  abstract = {Respiratory motion is a major source of artifacts in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Free-breathing techniques with pencil-beam navigators efficiently suppress respiratory motion and minimize the need for patient cooperation. However, the correlation between the measured navigator position and the actual position of the heart may be adversely affected by hysteretic effects, navigator position, and temporal delays between the navigators and the image acquisition. In addition, irregular breathing patterns during navigator-gated scanning may result in low scan efficiency and prolonged scan time. The purpose of this study was to develop and implement a self-navigated, free-breathing, whole-heart 3D coronary MRI technique that would overcome these shortcomings and improve the ease-of-use of coronary MRI. A signal synchronous with respiration was extracted directly from the echoes acquired for imaging, and the motion information was used for retrospective, rigid-body, through-plane motion correction. The images obtained from the self-navigated reconstruction were compared with the results from conventional, prospective, pencil-beam navigator tracking. Image quality was improved in phantom studies using self-navigation, while equivalent results were obtained with both techniques in preliminary in vivo studies.

The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated three-dimensional MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface--based environment requiring no further programming. This manuscript describes the concepts, methods, and performance of the software. Examples of novel simulation results in active fields of MRI research are given.

Spin echo-based diffusion-weighted sequences allow for single-shot acquisitions but are highly sensitive to cardiac motion. In this study, the use of second-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding was compared with first-order motion-compensated diffusion-weighted imaging during systolic contraction of the heart. METHODS: First- and second-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding gradients were incorporated into a triggered single-shot spin echo sequence. The effect of contractile motion on the apparent diffusion coefficients and tensor orientations was investigated in vivo from basal to apical level of the heart. RESULTS: Second-order motion compensation was found to increase the range of systolic trigger delays from 30\%-55\% to 15\%-77\% peak systole at the apex and from 25\%-50\% to 15\%-79\% peak systole at the base. Diffusion tensor analysis yielded more physiological transmural distributions when using second-order motion-compensated diffusion tensor imaging. CONCLUSION: Higher-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding decreases the sensitivity to cardiac motion, thereby enabling cardiac DTI over a wider range of time points during systolic contraction of the heart.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Myocardial microstructure has been challenging to probe in vivo. Spin echo-based diffusion-weighted sequences allow for single-shot acquisitions but are highly sensitive to cardiac motion. In this study, the use of second-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding was compared with first-order motion-compensated diffusion-weighted imaging during systolic contraction of the heart. METHODS: First- and second-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding gradients were incorporated into a triggered single-shot spin echo sequence. The effect of contractile motion on the apparent diffusion coefficients and tensor orientations was investigated in vivo from basal to apical level of the heart. RESULTS: Second-order motion compensation was found to increase the range of systolic trigger delays from 30\%-55\% to 15\%-77\% peak systole at the apex and from 25\%-50\% to 15\%-79\% peak systole at the base. Diffusion tensor analysis yielded more physiological transmural distributions when using second-order motion-compensated diffusion tensor imaging. CONCLUSION: Higher-order motion-compensated diffusion encoding decreases the sensitivity to cardiac motion, thereby enabling cardiac DTI over a wider range of time points during systolic contraction of the heart.},

Unlike conventional contrast-enhanced sequences, DCE-MRI allows the evaluation of the temporal pattern of enhancement in the musculoskeletal system, perhaps best known for its use in oncologic applications (such as differentiating benign from malignant tumors, evaluating for treatment response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and differentiating postsurgical changes from residual tumor). However, DCE-MRI can also be used to evaluate inflammatory processes such as Charcot foot and synovitis, and evaluate bone perfusion in entities like Legg Calve Perthes disease and arthritis. Finally, vascular abnormalities and associated complications may be better characterized with DCE-MRI than conventional imaging.

  abstract = {The structural heterogeneity of tumor tissue can be probed by diffusion MRI (dMRI) in terms of the variance of apparent diffusivities within a voxel. However, the link between the diffusional variance and the tissue heterogeneity is not well-established. To investigate this link we test the hypothesis that diffusional variance, caused by microscopic anisotropy and isotropic heterogeneity, is associated with variable cell eccentricity and cell density in brain tumors. We performed dMRI using a novel encoding scheme for diffusional variance decomposition (DIVIDE) in 7 meningiomas and 8 gliomas prior to surgery. The diffusional variance was quantified from dMRI in terms of the total mean kurtosis (MKT), and DIVIDE was used to decompose MKT into components caused by microscopic anisotropy (MKA) and isotropic heterogeneity (MKI). Diffusion anisotropy was evaluated in terms of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and microscopic fractional anisotropy ({$\mu$}FA). Quantitative microscopy was performed on the excised tumor tissue, where structural anisotropy and cell density were quantified by structure tensor analysis and cell nuclei segmentation, respectively. In order to validate the DIVIDE parameters they were correlated to the corresponding parameters derived from microscopy. We found an excellent agreement between the DIVIDE parameters and corresponding microscopy parameters; MKA correlated with cell eccentricity (r=0.95, p{$<$}10-7) and MKI with the cell density variance (r=0.83, p{$<$}10-3). The diffusion anisotropy correlated with structure tensor anisotropy on the voxel-scale (FA, r=0.80, p{$<$}10-3) and microscopic scale ({$\mu$}FA, r=0.93, p{$<$}10-6). A multiple regression analysis showed that the conventional MKT parameter reflects both variable cell eccentricity and cell density, and therefore lacks specificity in terms of microstructure characteristics. However, specificity was obtained by decomposing the two contributions; MKA was associated only to cell eccentricity, and MKI only to cell density variance. The variance in meningiomas was caused primarily by microscopic anisotropy (mean{\textpm}s.d.) MKA=1.11{\textpm}0.33 vs MKI=0.44{\textpm}0.20 (p{$<$}10-3), whereas in the gliomas, it was mostly caused by isotropic heterogeneity MKI=0.57{\textpm}0.30 vs MKA=0.26{\textpm}0.11 (p{$<$}0.05). In conclusion, DIVIDE allows non-invasive mapping of parameters that reflect variable cell eccentricity and density. These results constitute convincing evidence that a link exists between specific aspects of tissue heterogeneity and parameters from dMRI. Decomposing effects of microscopic anisotropy and isotropic heterogeneity facilitates an improved interpretation of tumor heterogeneity as well as diffusion anisotropy on both the microscopic and macroscopic scale.},

However, concomitant gradients may cause a residual gradient moment at the end of the waveform, which can cause significant signal error and image artifacts. The purpose of this study was to develop an asymmetric waveform designs for tensor-valued diffusion encoding that is not sensitive to concomitant gradients. Methods The ``Maxwell index'' was proposed as a scalar invariant to capture the effect of concomitant gradients. Optimization of ``Maxwell-compensated'' waveforms was performed in which this index was constrained. Resulting waveforms were compared to waveforms from literature, in terms of the measured and predicted impact of concomitant gradients, by numerical analysis as well as experiments in a phantom and in a healthy human brain. Results Maxwell-compensated waveforms with Maxwell indices below 100 (mT/m)2 ms showed negligible signal bias in both numerical analysis and experiments. By contrast, several waveforms from literature showed gross signal bias under the same conditions, leading to a signal bias that was large enough to markedly affect parameter maps. Experimental results were accurately predicted by theory. Conclusion Constraining the Maxwell index in the optimization of asymmetric gradient waveforms yields efficient diffusion encoding that negates the effects of concomitant fields while enabling arbitrary shapes of the b-tensor. This waveform design is especially useful in combination with strong gradients, long encoding times, thick slices, simultaneous multi-slice acquisition, and large FOVs.},

We propose a ``motion-compensated'' gradient waveform design for tensor-valued diffusion encoding that negates the effects bulk motion and incoherent motion in the ballistic regime. Methods Motion compensation was achieved by constraining the magnitude of gradient waveform moment vectors. The constraint was incorporated into a numerical optimization framework, along with existing constraints that account for b-tensor shape, hardware restrictions, and concomitant field gradients. We evaluated the efficacy of encoding and motion compensation in simulations, and we demonstrated the approach by linear and planar b-tensor encoding in a healthy heart in vivo. Results The optimization framework produced asymmetric motion-compensated waveforms that yielded b-tensors of arbitrary shape with improved efficiency compared with previous designs for tensor-valued encoding, and equivalent efficiency to previous designs for linear (conventional) encoding. Technical feasibility was demonstrated in the heart in vivo, showing vastly improved data quality when using motion compensation. The optimization framework is available online in open source. Conclusion Our gradient waveform design is both more flexible and efficient than previous methods, facilitating tensor-valued diffusion encoding in tissues in which motion would otherwise confound the signal. The proposed design exploits asymmetric encoding times, a single refocusing pulse or multiple refocusing pulses, and integrates compensation for concomitant gradient effects throughout the imaging volume.},

  abstract = {Purpose This work aims to develop a fast and practical computation method for MR simulations. The computational cost of MR simulations is often high because magnetizations of many isochromats are updated using a small step size on the order of microseconds. There are two types of subsequences to be processed for the simulations: subsequences with and without RF pulses. While straightforward implementations spend most of their time calculating subsequences with RF pulses, there is a method which efficiently reuses the computation for repetitive RF pulses. Theory and Methods A new method for efficiently processing subsequences with RF pulses is proposed. Rather than using an iterative update approach, the proposed method computes the combined transition which combines all transitions applied iteratively for each subsequence with RF pulses. The combined transition is used again when the same subsequence is used later. The combined transitions are cached and managed using a least recently used algorithm. Results The proposed method was found to accelerate the simulation by {\texttildelow}20 times when 3.9 million isochromats were simulated using spin-echo sequences. Even on a laptop computer, the proposed method was able to simulate these sequences in {\texttildelow}3.5 min. Conclusion An efficient method for simulating pulse sequences is proposed. The proposed method computes and manages combined transitions, making MR simulation practical on a wide range of computers, including laptops.},

Under normal flow conditions, the major vessels of the circle of Willis were consistently well demonstrated on these fast 3D TOF images. Signal saturation was observed in studies of patients with abnormal blood flow. In those cases, it was demonstrated that serial acquisition of fast 3D TOF data during and after contrast agent administration could be used to overcome the saturation effects.

  abstract = {Purpose Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to characterize cardiac tissue microstructure, necessitating the use of physiologically relevant phantoms for methods development. Existing phantoms are generally simplistic and mostly simulate diffusion in the brain. Thus, there is a need for phantoms mimicking diffusion in cardiac tissue. Materials and Methods A biomimetic phantom composed of hollow microfibers generated using co-electrospinning was developed to mimic myocardial diffusion properties and fiber and sheet orientations. Diffusion tensor imaging was carried out at monthly intervals over 4 months at 9.4T. 3D fiber tracking was performed using the phantom and compared with fiber tracking in an ex vivo rat heart. Results The mean apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy of the phantom remained stable over the 4-month period, with mean values of 7.53 {\textpm} 0.16 {\texttimes} 10-4 mm2/s and 0.388 {\textpm} 0.007, respectively. Fiber tracking of the 1st and 3rd eigenvectors generated analogous results to the fiber and sheet-normal direction respectively, found in the left ventricular myocardium. Conclusion A biomimetic phantom simulating diffusion in the heart was designed and built. This could aid development and validation of novel diffusion MRI methods for investigating cardiac microstructure, decrease the number of animals and patients needed for methods development, and improve quality control in longitudinal and multicenter cardiac diffusion MRI studies.

  abstract = {Myocardial microstructure and its macroscopic materialisation are fundamental to the function of the heart. Despite this importance, characterisation of cellular features at the organ level remains challenging, and a unifying description of the structure of the heart is still outstanding. Here, we optimised diffusion tensor imaging data to acquire high quality data in ex~vivo rabbit hearts in slack and contractured states, approximating diastolic and systolic conditions. The data were analysed with a suite of methods that focused on different aspects of the myocardium. In the slack heart, we observed a similar transmural gradient in helix angle of the primary eigenvector of up to 23.6{$^\circ$}/mm in the left ventricle and 24.2{$^\circ$}/mm in the right ventricle. In the contractured heart, the same transmural gradient remained largely linear, but was offset by up to~+49.9{$^\circ$} in the left ventricle. In the right ventricle, there was an increase in the transmural gradient to 31.2{$^\circ$}/mm and an offset of up to~+39.0{$^\circ$}. The application of tractography based on each eigenvector enabled visualisation of streamlines that depict cardiomyocyte and sheetlet organisation over large distances. We observed multiple V- and N-shaped sheetlet arrangements throughout the myocardium, and insertion of sheetlets at the intersection of the left and right ventricle. This study integrates several complementary techniques to visualise and quantify the heart's microstructure, projecting parameter representations across different length scales. This represents a step towards a more comprehensive characterisation of myocardial microstructure at the whole organ level.},

Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained; informed consent was waived for this HIPAA-compliant study. One hundred twenty consecutive patients who underwent 3.0-T three-dimensional high-spatial-resolution contrast material--enhanced MR angiography of the supraaortic arteries with an identical acquisition protocol were assigned to either the high-dose (0.154 mmol per kilogram of body weight), intermediate-dose (0.097 mmol/kg), or low-dose (0.047 mmol/kg) group. Two readers evaluated resulting images for arterial definition, venous contamination, and arterial stenosis. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were evaluated at six consistent sites. Statistical analysis was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon signed rank, and analysis of variance tests and the {$\kappa$} coefficient. Results: Readers 1 and 2 scored vascular definition as excellent or sufficient for diagnosis in 1311 of 1360 segments and in 1313 of 1360 segments in the high-dose group ({$\kappa$} = 0.73), in 1321 of 1354 and in 1319 of 1354 segments in the intermediate-dose group ({$\kappa$} = 0.77), and in 1322 of 1350 and in 1320 of 1350 segments in the low-dose group ({$\kappa$}= 0.66), respectively. Arterial occlusive disease was detected by reader 1 in 52, 27, and 98 segments in the high-, intermediate-, and low-dose groups, respectively. Arterial occlusive disease was detected by reader 2 in 48, 25, and 100 segments in high-, intermediate-, and low-dose groups, respectively. No significant difference existed among the three groups regarding arterial definition scores (reader 1, P = .21; reader 2, P = .25) and venous contamination scores (reader 1, P = .38; reader 2, P = .35). SNRs and CNRs were lower in the low-dose group (P {$<$} .01). Conclusion: At 3.0 T, high-spatial-resolution MR angiography of the supraaortic arteries can be performed with contrast agent doses as low as 0.047 mmol/kg, without compromising image quality, acquisition speed, or spatial resolution.

Here we revisit the basic physics of solid-state NMR and diffusion MRI to pinpoint the origin of the somewhat unexpected analogy between the two fields, and provide an overview of current diffusion MRI acquisition protocols and data analysis methods to quantify the composition of heterogeneous materials in terms of diffusion tensor distributions with size, shape, and orientation dimensions. While the most advanced methods allow estimation of the complete multidimensional distributions, simpler methods focus on various projections onto lower-dimensional spaces as well as determination of means and variances rather than actual distributions. Even the less advanced methods provide simple and intuitive scalar parameters that are directly related to microstructural features that can be observed in optical microscopy images, e.g. average cell eccentricity, variance of cell density, and orientational order -- properties that are inextricably entangled in conventional diffusion MRI. Key to disentangling all these microstructural features is MRI signal acquisition combining isotropic and directional dimensions, just as in the field of multidimensional solid-state NMR from which most of the ideas for the new methods are derived.},

With this, we intend to measure the impact, in terms of user experience, of including an ITS in our simulator. Methods: We thoroughly describe the integration procedure and we have tested the benefits of this integration by means of two actual educational experiences, with one of them using the simulator as a standalone tool, and the other with the joint use of simulator+ITS. The experiences have consisted of two online courses with a number of students around 180 in both of them, where measurements of usability, perceived utility and likelihood to recommend were collected. Results: We have observed that the three measurements improved noticeably in the second course with respect to the first one; specifically, overall usability improved by 22.3\%, perceived utility by an average of 55.1\% and likelihood to recommend by 13.7\%. In addition, quantitative measurements are complemented with comments in free text format directly provided by the students. Results show evidence on the benefits of integrating an ITS in terms of quantitative user experience, as well as qualitative comparative comments directly by students of both courses. Conclusions: This is the first time that an ITS is used within the scope of MR simulation for training purposes. Benefits of integrating an ITS within an MR simulator have been evaluated in terms of user experience, with satisfactory comparative results.},

Despite some simulators having been developed for training purposes, we are not aware of any attempt to quantitatively measure their educational performance. The present study gives an answer to the question: Does an MRI simulator built on specific functional and non-functional requirements help radiographers learn MRI theoretical and practical concepts better than traditional educational method based on lectures? Our study was carried out in a single day by a total of 60 students of a main hospital in Madrid, Spain. The experiment followed a randomized pre-test post-test design with a control group that used a traditional educational method, and an experimental group that used our simulator. Knowledge level was assessed by means of an instrument with evidence of validity in its format and content, while its reliability was analyzed after the experiment. Statistical differences between both groups were measured. Significant statistical differences were found in favor of the participants who used the simulator for both the post-test score and the gain (difference between post-test and pre-test scores). The effect size turned out to be significant as well. In this work we evaluated a magnetic resonance simulation paradigm as a tool to help in the training of radiographers. The study shows that a simulator built on specific design requirements is a valuable complement to traditional education procedures, backed up with significant quantitative results.},

The tool follows the client-server model. The client contains the interface that mimics the console of a real machine and several of its features. The server stores anatomical models and executes the bulk of the simulation. This cross-platform simulator has been used in two real educational scenarios. The acceptance of the tool has been measured using two criteria, namely, the System Usability Scale and the Likelihood to Recommend, both with satisfactory results.

  abstract = {A number of computational techniques have been lately devised to image the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) within the white matter of the brain, propelled by the deployment of multi-shell acquisition protocols and databases: approaches like Mean Apparent Propagator Imaging (MAP-MRI) and its Laplacian-regularized version (MAPL) aim at describing the low frequency spectrum of the EAP (limited by the maximum b-value acquired) and afterwards computing scalar indices that embed useful descriptions of the white matter, e.~g. the Return-to-Origin, Plane, or Axis Probabilities (RTOP, RTPP, RTAP). These methods resort to a non-parametric, bandwidth limited representation of the EAP that implies fitting a set of 3-D basis functions in a large-scale optimization problem. We propose a semi-parametric approach inspired by signal theory: the EAP is approximated as the spherical convolution of a Micro-Structure adaptive Gaussian kernel with a non-parametric orientation histogram, which aims at representing the low-frequency response of an ensemble of coherent sets of fiber bundles at the white matter. This way, the optimization involves just the 2 to 3 parameters that describe the kernel, making our approach far more efficient than the related state of the art. We devise dual Fourier domains Integral Transforms to analytically compute RTxP-like scalar indices as moments of arbitrary orders over either the whole 3-D space, particular directions, or particular planes. The so-called MiSFIT is both time efficient (a typical multi-shell data set can be processed in roughly one minute) and accurate: it provides estimates of widely validated indices like RTOP, RTPP, and RTAP comparable to MAPL for a wide variety of white matter configurations.},

The two main approaches are: SENSE, which explicitly uses coil sensitivities, and GRAPPA, which makes use of learned correlations in k-space. The purpose of this work is to clarify their relationship and to develop and evaluate an improved algorithm. THEORY AND METHODS: A theoretical analysis shows: (1) The correlations in k-space are encoded in the null space of a calibration matrix. (2) Both approaches restrict the solution to a subspace spanned by the sensitivities. (3) The sensitivities appear as the main eigenvector of a reconstruction operator computed from the null space. The basic assumptions and the quality of the sensitivity maps are evaluated in experimental examples. The appearance of additional eigenvectors motivates an extended SENSE reconstruction with multiple maps, which is compared to existing methods. RESULTS: The existence of a null space and the high quality of the extracted sensitivities are confirmed. The extended reconstruction combines all advantages of SENSE with robustness to certain errors similar to GRAPPA. CONCLUSION: In this article the gap between both approaches is finally bridged. A new autocalibration technique combines the benefits of both.},

  abstract = {Purpose To assess the optimal timing for coronary magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in children with congenital heart disease by using dual cardiac phase whole-heart MR imaging. Materials and Methods The local institutional review board approved this study, and informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians. Thirty children (13 girls; overall mean age, 5.01 years) were examined with a 1.5-T MR system. A free-breathing three-dimensional steady-state free precession dual cardiac phase sequence was used to obtain MR angiographic data during end-systolic and middiastolic rest periods. Vessel length, diameter, and sharpness, as well as image quality of the coronary artery segments, were analyzed and compared by using Bland-Altman plots, linear regression analysis, the t test, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results Optimal coronary artery imaging timing was patient dependent and different for each coronary artery segment (36 segments favored end systole, 28 favored middiastole). In 15 patients (50\%), different segments favored different cardiac phases within the same patient. Image quality and vessel sharpness degraded with higher heart rates, with a similar correlation for end systole (right coronary artery [RCA], 0.39; left main [LM] coronary artery, 0.46; left anterior descending [LAD] artery, 0.51; and left circumflex [LCX] artery, 0.50) and middiastole (RCA, 0.34; LM, 0.45; LAD, 0.48; and LCx, 0.55). Mean image quality difference or mean vessel sharpness difference showed no indication to prefer a specific cardiac phase. Conclusion The optimal cardiac rest period for coronary MR angiography in children with congenital heart disease is specific for each coronary artery segment. Dual cardiac phase whole-heart coronary MR angiography enables optimal coronary artery visualization by retrospectively choosing the optimal imaging rest period. {\copyright} RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101659/-/DC1}

Our approach uses two 2x2x1 inch Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets in the 0.6 T range, and large cylindrical (5 inch diameter, one inch thick) field- spreading pole pieces made of soft steel, along with a one-half-inch-thick walled soft- steel enclosure. This design trades away field strength for uniformity in order to get a large enough volume (at least a 1 cm cube) of highly-uniform 0.08 T in which the NMR phenomenon is easily observed. While others have demonstrated and/or market more complex and elegant benchtop NMR or MRI systems generally costing several thousands of dollars (e.g. TeachSpin{\textregistered}), our goal was to create a simple tool which would be inexpensive enough so that there could be one per lab bench in an imaging course. The magnetic field is also well contained in this design, and not strong enough to represent a significant hazard or nuisance. The component cost (including magnets) for this system is approximately \$400 and it can demonstrate Free Induction Decay and Spin Echo. The sample used can be a small container of glycerin. It is assumed that an oscilloscope and a bench power supply are available. This module is was used in the form of a lecture demonstration of the Spin Echo experiment in the Northwestern University Biomedical Engineering course BME 325, Introduction to Medical Imaging, during the Fall 2004 quarter. This course includes undergraduate and graduate students from both ECE and BME majors. We report our experiences and a formal evaluation of the effectiveness of the module.}

  abstract = {The basis pursuit problem seeks a minimum one-norm solution of an underdetermined least-squares problem. Basis pursuit denoise (BPDN) fits the least-squares problem only approximately, and a single parameter determines a curve that traces the optimal trade-off between the least-squares fit and the one-norm of the solution. We prove that this curve is convex and continuously differentiable over all points of interest, and show that it gives an explicit relationship to two other optimization problems closely related to BPDN. We describe a root-finding algorithm for finding arbitrary points on this curve; the algorithm is suitable for problems that are large scale and for those that are in the complex domain. At each iteration, a spectral gradient-projection method approximately minimizes a least-squares problem with an explicit one-norm constraint. Only matrix-vector operations are required. The primal-dual solution of this problem gives function and derivative information needed for the root-finding method. Numerical experiments on a comprehensive set of test problems demonstrate that the method scales well to large problems.},

  abstract = {Purpose To improve the quality of mean apparent propagator (MAP) reconstruction from a limited number of q-space samples. Methods We implement an -regularised MAP (MAPL1) to consider higher order basis functions and to improve the fit without increasing the number of q-space samples. We compare MAPL1 with the least-squares optimization subject to non-negativity (MAP), and the Laplacian-regularized MAP (MAPL). We use simulations of crossing fibers and compute the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and the Pearson's correlation coefficient to evaluate the reconstruction quality in q-space. We also compare coefficient-based diffusion indices in the simulations and in in vivo data. Results Results indicate that MAPL1 improves NMSE in 1 to 3\% when compared to MAP or MAPL in a high undersampling regime. Additionally, MAPL1 produces more reproducible and accurate results for all sampling rates when there are enough basis functions to meet the sparsity criterion for the regularizer. These improved reconstructions also produce better coefficient-based diffusion indices for in vivo data. Conclusions Adding an regularizer to MAP allows the use of more basis functions and a better fit without increasing the number of q-space samples. The impact of our research is that a complete diffusion spectrum can be reconstructed from an acquisition time very similar to a diffusion tensor imaging protocol.},

  abstract = {A low field strength (B0) system could increase cardiac MRI availability for patients otherwise contraindicated at higher field. Lower equipment costs could also broaden cardiac MR accessibility. The current study investigated the feasibility of cardiac function with steady-state free precession and flow assessment with phase contrast (PC) cine images at 0.35 T, and evaluated differences in myocardial relaxation times using quantitative T1, T2 and T2* maps by comparison with 1.5 and 3 T results in a small cohort of six healthy volunteers. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) differences across systems were characterized with proton density-weighted spin echo phantom data. SNR at 0.35 T was lower by factors of 5.5 and 15.0 compared with the 1.5 and 3 T systems used in this study. All cine images at 0.35 T scored 3 or greater on a five-point image quality scale. Normalized blood-myocardium contrast in cine images, left ventricular volumes (end diastolic volume, end systolic volume) and function (ejection fraction and stroke volume) measures at 0.35 T matched 1.5 and 3 T results. Phase-to-noise ratio in 0.35 T PC images (11.7 {\textpm} 1.9) was lower than 1.5 T (18.7 {\textpm} 5.2) and 3 T (44.9 {\textpm} 16.5). Peak velocity and stroke volume determined from PC images were similar across systems. Myocardial T1 increased (564 {\textpm} 13 ms at 0.35 T, 955 {\textpm} 19 ms at 1.5 T and 1200 {\textpm} 35 ms at 3 T) while T2 (59 {\textpm} 4 ms at 0.35 T, 49 {\textpm} 3 ms at 1.5 T and 40 {\textpm} 2 ms at 3 T) and T2* (42 {\textpm} 8 ms at 0.35 T, 33 {\textpm} 6 ms at 1.5 T and 24 {\textpm} 3 ms at 3 T) decreased with increasing B0. Despite SNR deficits, cardiovascular function, flow assessment and myocardial relaxation parameter mapping is feasible at 0.35 T using standard cardiovascular imaging sequences.},

  abstract = {Purpose This work presents an end-to-end open-source MR imaging workflow. It is highly flexible in rapid prototyping across the whole imaging process and integrates vendor-independent openly available tools. The whole workflow can be shared and executed on different MR platforms. It is also integrated in the JEMRIS simulation framework, which makes it possible to generate simulated data from the same sequence that runs on the MRI scanner using the same pipeline for image reconstruction. Methods MRI sequences can be designed in Python or JEMRIS using the Pulseq framework, allowing simplified integration of new sequence design tools. During the sequence design process, acquisition metadata required for reconstruction is stored in the MR raw data format. Data acquisition is possible on MRI scanners supported by Pulseq and in simulations through JEMRIS. An image reconstruction and postprocessing pipeline was implemented into a Python server that allows real-time processing of data as it is being acquired. The Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox is integrated into this framework for image reconstruction. The reconstruction pipeline supports online integration through a vendor-dependent interface. Results The flexibility of the workflow is demonstrated with different examples, containing 3D parallel imaging with controlled aliasing in volumetric parallel imaging (CAIPIRINHA) acceleration, spiral imaging, and B0 mapping. All sequences, data, and the corresponding processing pipelines are publicly available. Conclusion The proposed workflow is highly flexible and allows integration of advanced tools at all stages of the imaging process. All parts of this workflow are open-source, simplifying collaboration across different MR platforms or sites and improving reproducibility of results.},

  abstract = {Purpose Linear least squares estimators are widely used in diffusion MRI for the estimation of diffusion parameters. Although adding proper weights is necessary to increase the precision of these linear estimators, there is no consensus on how to practically define them. In this study, the impact of the commonly used weighting strategies on the accuracy and precision of linear diffusion parameter estimators is evaluated and compared with the nonlinear least squares estimation approach. Methods Simulation and real data experiments were done to study the performance of the weighted linear least squares estimators with weights defined by (a) the squares of the respective noisy diffusion-weighted signals; and (b) the squares of the predicted signals, which are reconstructed from a previous estimate of the diffusion model parameters. Results The negative effect of weighting strategy (a) on the accuracy of the estimator was surprisingly high. Multi-step weighting strategies yield better performance and, in some cases, even outperformed the nonlinear least squares estimator. Conclusion If proper weighting strategies are applied, the weighted linear least squares approach shows high performance characteristics in terms of accuracy/precision and may even be preferred over nonlinear estimation methods.},

In this study, the previously proposed aqueous solutions of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were examined and temperature calibrations were obtained. For example, at a temperature of 20{$^\circ$}C, Dapp ranged from 1.594 (95\% CI: 1.593, 1.595) {$\mu$}m2/ms to 0.3326 (95\% CI: 0. 3304, 0.3348) {$\mu$}m2/ms for PVP-concentrations ranging from 10\% (w/w) to 50\% (w/w) using K30 polymer lengths. The temperature dependence of Dapp was found to be so strong that a negligence seems not advisable. The temperature dependence is descriptively modelled by an exponential function exp(c2 (T - 20{$^\circ$}C)) and the determined c2 values are reported, which can be used for temperature calibration. For example, we find the value 0.02952 K-1 for 30\% (w/w) PVP-concentration and K30 polymer length. In general, aqueous PVP solutions were found to be suitable to produce easily applicable and reliable Dapp-phantoms.},

The permanent magnetic circuit comprises a magnetic yoke, main magnetic steel, nonspherical curved-surface magnetic poles, plugging magnetic steel, and side magnetic steel. In this work, a novel shimming method is proposed for the effective correction of base magnetic field (B 0) inhomogeneities, which is based on passive shimming on the telescope aspheric cutting, grinding, and fine processing technology of the nonspherical curved-surface magnetic poles and active shimming adding higher-order gradient coils. Meanwhile, the magnetic resonance imaging dedicated alloy with high-saturation magnetic field induction intensity and high electrical resistivity is developed, and nonspherical curved-surface magnetic poles which are made of the dedicated alloy have very good anti-eddy-current effect. In addition, the large temperature coefficient problem of permanent magnet can be effectively controlled by using a high quality temperature controller and deuterium external locking technique. Combining our patents such as gradient coil, RF coil, and integration computer software, two kinds of small animal Micro-MRI instruments are developed, by which the high quality MRI images of mice were obtained.},

  abstract = {It has been previously shown that intrinsic metabolites can be imaged based on their water proton exchange rates using saturation transfer techniques. The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate chemical exchange site that could be developed for use as an exogenous chemical exchange dependent saturation transfer (CEST) contrast agent under physiological conditions. These agents would function by reducing the water proton signal through a chemical exchange site on the agent via saturation transfer. The ideal chemical exchange site would have a large chemical shift from water. This permits a high exchange rate without approaching the fast exchange limit at physiological pH (6.5-7.6) and temperature (37 degrees C), as well as minimizing problems associated with magnetic field susceptibility. Numerous candidate chemicals (amino acids, sugars, nucleotides, heterocyclic ring chemicals) were evaluated in this preliminary study. Of these, barbituric acid and 5, 6-dihydrouracil were more fully characterized with regard to pH, temperature, and concentration CEST effects. The best chemical exchange site found was the 5.33-ppm indole ring -NH site of 5-hydroxytryptophan. These data demonstrate that a CEST-based exogenous contrast agent for MRI is feasible.},

  abstract = {Current implementations of coronary artery magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) suffer from limited coverage of the coronary arterial system. Whole-heart coronary MRA was implemented based on a free-breathing steady-state free-precession (SSFP) technique with magnetization preparation. The technique was compared to a similar implementation of conventional, thin-slab coronary MRA in 12 normal volunteers. Three thin-slab volumes were prescribed: 1) a transverse slab, covering the left main (LM) artery and proximal segments of the left anterior ascending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries; 2) a double-oblique slab covering the right coronary artery (RCA); and 3) a double-oblique slab covering the proximal and distal segments of the LCX. The whole-heart data set was reformatted in identical orientations. Visible vessel length, vessel sharpness, and vessel diameter were determined and compared separately for each vessel. Whole-heart coronary MRA visualized LM/LAD (11.7 {\textpm} 3.4 cm) and LCX (6.9 {\textpm} 3.6 cm) over a significantly longer distance than the transverse volume (LM/LAD, 6.1 {\textpm} 1.1 cm, P {$<$} 0.001; LCX, 4.2 {\textpm} 1.2 cm, P {$<$} 0.05). Improvements in visible vessel length for RCA and LCX in the whole-heart approach vs. their respective targeted volumes were not significant. It is concluded that the whole-heart coronary MRA technique improves visible vessel length and facilitates high-quality coronary MRA of the complete coronary artery tree in a single measurement.

  abstract = {Purpose To present an open-source MR simulation framework that facilitates the incorporation of complex motion and flow for studying cardiovascular MR (CMR) acquisition and reconstruction. Methods CMRsim is a Python package that allows simulation of CMR images using dynamic digital phantoms with complex motion as input. Two simulation paradigms are available, namely, numerical and analytical solutions to the Bloch equations, using a common motion representation. Competitive simulation speeds are achieved using TensorFlow for GPU acceleration. To demonstrate the capability of the package, one introductory and two advanced CMR simulation experiments are presented. The latter showcase phase-contrast imaging of turbulent flow downstream of a stenotic section and cardiac diffusion tensor imaging on a contracting left ventricle. Additionally, extensive documentation and example resources are provided. Results The Bloch simulation with turbulent flow using approximately 1.5 million particles and a sequence duration of 710 ms for each of the seven different velocity encodings took a total of 29 min on a NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU. The results show characteristic phase contrast and magnitude modulation present in real data. The analytical simulation of cardiac diffusion tensor imaging with bulk-motion phase sensitivity took approximately 10 s per diffusion-weighted image, including preparation and loading steps. The results exhibit the expected alteration of diffusion metrics due to strain. Conclusion CMRsim is the first simulation framework that allows one to feasibly incorporate complex motion, including turbulent flow, to systematically study advanced CMR acquisition and reconstruction approaches. The open-source package features modularity and transparency, facilitating maintainability and extensibility in support of reproducible research.},

Even with velocity compensation via, for example, bipolar encoding pulses, the variable shot-to-shot residual motion-induced spin phase can still give rise to pronounced artifacts. This study presents diffusion-encoding schemes that are designed to compensate for higher-order motion components, including acceleration and jerk, which also have the desirable practical features of minimal TEs and high achievable b-values. The effectiveness of these schemes was verified numerically on a realistic beating heart phantom, and demonstrated empirically with in vivo cardiac diffusion MRI in rats. Compensation for acceleration, and lower motion components, was found to be both necessary and sufficient for obtaining diffusion-weighted images of acceptable quality and SNR, which yielded the first in vivo cardiac DTI demonstrated in the rat. These findings suggest that compensation for higher order motion, particularly acceleration, can be an effective alternative solution to high-performance gradient hardware for improving in vivo cardiac DTI.},

The standard Stejskal-Tanner sequence uses one single pair of such gradients, known as single-PFG (sPFG). In this work we describe how trajectories in q-space can be used for diffusion encoding. We discuss how such encoding enables the extension of the well-known scalar b-value to a tensor-valued entity we call the diffusion measurement tensor. The new measurements contain information about higher order diffusion propagator covariances not present in sPFG. As an example analysis, we use this new information to estimate a Gaussian distribution over diffusion tensors in each voxel, described by its mean (a diffusion tensor) and its covariance (a 4th order tensor).},

The pseudo-first-order rate constant for the movement of magnetization from 1Hf to 1Hr was approximately 1 s-1 in kidney and approximately 3 s-1 in skeletal muscle in vivo. Proton NMR imaging demonstrated that this exchange was tissue specific and generated a novel form of NMR image contrast. The extent of exchange between 1Hf and 1Hr as well as the topological correlation of the exchange with relaxation weighted images suggests that this pathway is a major determinant of the observed relaxation properties of water 1H in vivo.},

The cost and complexity of these systems often makes them impractical for use as routine laboratory instruments, limiting their use to hospitals and dedicated laboratories. However, advances in the consumer electronics industry have led to the widespread availability of inexpensive radio-frequency integrated circuits with exceptional abilities. We have developed a small, low-cost MR system derived from these new components. When combined with inexpensive desktop magnets, this type of MR scanner has the promise of becoming standard laboratory equipment for both research and education. This paper describes the development of a prototype desktop MR scanner utilizing a 0.21 T permanent magnet with an imaging region of approximately 2 cm diameter. The system uses commercially available components where possible and is programmed in LabVIEW software. Results from 3D data sets of resolution phantoms and fixed, newborn mice demonstrate the capability of this system to obtain useful images from a system constructed for approximately \$13 500.},

We used DT-MRI to investigate changes in direction-dependent water diffusivity to reflect alterations in tissue integrity (trace apparent diffusion coefficients [ADCs] and fractional anisotropy [FA]), as well as indicators of remodeling of fiber helix angles, in patients after myocardial infarction.Methods and Results--- Thirty-seven patients (35 men, 2 women; median age, 59) after acute myocardial infarction (median interval from onset, 26 days) were enrolled. DT-MRI was performed at the midventricular level to measure trace ADC, FA, and helix angles of myofibers. Helix angles were grouped into left-handed helical fibers, circumferential fibers, and right-handed helical fibers. Measurements were correlated with viability and regional wall motion assessed by contrast-delay-enhancement and cine MRI, respectively. The infarct zone showed significantly increased trace ADC and decreased FA than the remote zone. The percentage of left-handed helical fibers increased from the remote zone (mean{\textpm}SD, 13.3{\textpm}5.8\%) to the adjacent zone (19.2{\textpm}9.7\%) and infarct zone (25.8{\textpm}18.4\%) (MANOVA, P=0.004). The percentage of right-handed helical fibers decreased from the remote zone (35.0{\textpm}9.0\%) to the adjacent zone (25.5{\textpm}11.5\%) and infarct zone (15.9{\textpm}9.2\%) (P{$<$}0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that the percentage of left-handed helical fibers of the infarct zone was the strongest correlate of infarct size and predictor of ejection fraction.Conclusions--- In vivo DT-MRI of postinfarct myocardium revealed a significant increase in trace ADC and a decrease in FA, indicating altered tissue integrity. The redistribution of fiber architecture correlated with infarct size and left ventricular function. This technique may help us understand structural correlates of functional remodeling after infarction.},

The purpose of this work is to enable the combination of iterative golden angle radial sparse parallel MRI with balanced SSFP using the recently presented tiny golden angles. Methods The tiny golden angle trajectories are analyzed for their incoherence properties in relation to sparse imaging using the time-resolved point-spread functions. Tiny golden angle radial sparse parallel (tyGRASP) MRI is introduced and evaluated with applications in cardiac imaging and dynamic imaging of the temporomandibular joint. The results are analyzed in detail for 3 T and verified for 1.5 T. Results The incoherence properties of the tiny golden angle trajectory are comparable to the incoherence properties of the golden angle trajectory and are well suited for sparse MRI reconstruction. The proposed tiny golden angle radial sparse parallel MRI method strongly reduces eddy current related artifacts for both applications.

We hypothesized that such an online MR simulation platform could be utilized as a virtual MRI scanner but also as a cloud-based, high-performance engine for advanced MR simulations in simulation-based quantitative MR (qMR) methods. Methods and results The simulation framework of coreMRI was based on the solution of the Bloch equations and utilized a ground-up-approach design based on the principles already published in the literature. The development of a front-end environment allowed the connection of the end-users to the GPU-equipped instances on the cloud. The coreMRI simulation platform was based on a modular design where individual modules (such as the Gadgetron reconstruction framework and a newly developed Pulse Sequence Designer) could be inserted in the main simulation framework. Different types and sources of pulse sequences and anatomical models were utilized in this study revealing the flexibility that the coreMRI simulation platform offers to the users. The performance and scalability of coreMRI were also examined on multi-GPU configurations on the cloud, showing that a multi-GPU computer on the cloud equipped with a newer generation of GPU cards could significantly mitigate the prolonged execution times that accompany more realistic MRI and qMR simulations. Conclusions coreMRI is available to the entire MR community, whereas its high performance and scalability allow its users to configure advanced MRI experiments without the constraints imposed by experimentation in a true MRI scanner (such as time constraint and limited availability of MR scanners), without upfront investment for purchasing advanced computer systems and without any user expertise on computer programming or MR physics. coreMRI is available to the users through the webpage https://www.coreMRI.org.},

The aim was to develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulator that makes no assumptions with respect to the underlying pulse sequence and also allows for complex large-scale analysis on a single computer without requiring simplifications of the MRI model. We hypothesized that such a simulation platform could be developed with parallel acceleration of the executable core within the graphic processing unit (GPU) environment. MRISIMUL integrates realistic aspects of the MRI experiment from signal generation to image formation and solves the entire complex problem for densely spaced isochromats and for a densely spaced time axis. The simulation platform was developed in MATLAB whereas the computationally demanding core services were developed in CUDA-C. The MRISIMUL simulator imaged three different computer models: a user-defined phantom, a human brain model and a human heart model. The high computational power of GPU-based simulations was compared against other computer configurations. A speedup of about 228 times was achieved when compared to serially executed C-code on the CPU whereas a speedup between 31 to 115 times was achieved when compared to the OpenMP parallel executed C-code on the CPU, depending on the number of threads used in multithreading (2-8 threads). The high performance of MRISIMUL allows its application in large-scale analysis and can bring the computational power of a supercomputer or a large computer cluster to a single GPU personal computer.},

Action currents in the heart produce a magnetic field, which could provide a way to detect the propagation of electrical activity through cardiac tissue using magnetic resonance imaging. However, the magnetic field produced by current in the heart is small. The key question addressed in this study is are cardiac biomagnetic fields large enough to be detectable by MRI? Results. A spherical model is used to calculate the magnetic field inside the heart, which has a magnitude of about 14 nT. This field implies a phase shift in the MRI signal of about 0.2{$^\circ$}. Conclusion. Phase shifts associated with cardiac action currents will be difficult to detect using current MRI technology but may be possible if motion artifacts and other physiological noise can be suppressed.},

  abstract = {Variable flip angle T(1) mapping and actual flip-angle imaging B(1) mapping are widely used quantitative MRI methods employing radiofrequency spoiled gradient-echo pulse sequences. Incomplete elimination of the transverse magnetization in these sequences has been found to be a critical source of T(1) and B(1) measurement errors. In this study, comprehensive theoretical analysis of spoiling-related errors in variable flip angle and actual flip-angle imaging methods was performed using the combined isochromat summation and diffusion propagator model and validated by phantom experiments. The key theoretical conclusion is that correct interpretation of spoiling phenomena in fast gradient-echo sequences requires accurate consideration of the diffusion effect. A general strategy for improvement of T(1) and B(1) measurement accuracy was proposed based on the strong spoiling regimen, where diffusion-modulated spatial averaging of isochromats becomes a dominant factor determining magnetization evolution. Practical implementation of strongly spoiled variable flip angle and actual flip-angle imaging techniques requires sufficiently large spoiling gradient areas (A(G)) in combination with optimal radiofrequency phase increments (phi(0)). Optimal regimens providing {$<$}2\% relative T(1) and B(1) measurement errors in a variety of tissues were theoretically derived for prospective in vivo variable flip angle (pulse repetition time = 15-20 ms, A(G) = 280-450 mT.ms/m, phi(0) = 169 degrees) and actual flip-angle imaging (pulse repetition time(1)/pulse repetition time(2) = 20/100 ms, A(G1)/A(G2) = 450/2250 mT.ms/m, phi(0) = 39 degrees) applications based on 25 mT/m maximal available gradient strength.},

The need of integrating blood vessels brings additional complexity, limiting the available approaches that are suitable to produce integrated cardiovascular organoids. In this work we propose a novel hybrid strategy based on 3D bioprinting, to fabricate endothelialized myocardium. Enabled by the use of our composite bioink, endothelial cells directly bioprinted within microfibrous hydrogel scaffolds gradually migrated towards the peripheries of the microfibers to form a layer of confluent endothelium. Together with controlled anisotropy, this 3D endothelial bed was then seeded with cardiomyocytes to generate aligned myocardium capable of spontaneous and synchronous contraction. We further embedded the organoids into a specially designed microfluidic perfusion bioreactor to complete the endothelialized-myocardium-on-a-chip platform for cardiovascular toxicity evaluation. Finally, we demonstrated that such a technique could be translated to human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to construct endothelialized human myocardium. We believe that our method for generation of endothelialized organoids fabricated through an innovative 3D bioprinting technology may find widespread applications in regenerative medicine, drug screening, and potentially disease modeling.},

A dephasing gradient in the diffusion preparation module and rephasing gradients in the turbo spin echo module create stimulated echoes, which prevent signal loss caused by eddy currents. Near to perfect agreement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values between DPsti-TSE and diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging (DW-EPI) was demonstrated in both phantom transient signal experiments and phantom imaging experiments. High-resolution and undistorted DPsti-TSE was demonstrated in vivo in prostate and carotid vessel wall. 3D whole-prostate DWI was achieved with four b values in only 6 min. Undistorted ADC maps of the prostate peripheral zone were obtained at low and high imaging resolutions with no change in mean ADC values [(1.60 {\textpm} 0.10) {\texttimes} 10-3 versus (1.60 {\textpm} 0.02) {\texttimes} 10-3 mm2/s]. High-resolution 3D DWI of the carotid vessel wall was achieved in 12 min, with consistent ADC values [(1.40 {\textpm} 0.23) {\texttimes} 10-3 mm2/s] across different subjects, as well as slice locations through the imaging volume. This study shows that DPsti-TSE can serve as a robust 3D diffusion-weighted sequence and is an attractive alternative to the traditional two-dimensional DW-EPI approaches.},

Methods A novel approach for the design of diffusion weighting waveforms, termed M1-optimized diffusion imaging (MODI), is proposed. MODI includes an echo time-optimized motion-robust diffusion weighting gradient waveform design, with a small nonzero first-moment motion sensitivity (M1) value to enable blood signal suppression. Experiments were performed in eight healthy volunteers and five patient volunteers. In each case, DW images and ADC maps were compared between acquisitions using standard monopolar waveforms, motion moment-nulled (M1-nulled and M1--M2-nulled) waveforms, and the proposed MODI approach. Results Healthy volunteer experiments using MODI showed no significant ADC bias in the left lobe relative to the right lobe (p {$<$} .05) demonstrating robustness to cardiac motion, and no significant ADC bias with respect to monopolar-based ADC measured in the right lobe (p {$<$} .05), demonstrating blood signal suppression. In contrast, monopolar-based ADC showed significant bias in the left lobe relative to the right lobe (p {$<$} .01) due to its sensitivity to motion, and both M1-nulled and M1--M2-nulled-based ADC showed significant bias (p {$<$} .01) due to the lack of blood suppression. Preliminary patient results also suggest MODI may enable improved visualization and quantitative assessment of lesions throughout the entire liver. Conclusions This novel method for diffusion gradient waveform design enables DWI of the liver with high robustness to motion and suppression of blood signals, overcoming the limitations of conventional monopolar waveforms and moment-nulled waveforms, respectively.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), a practical diffusion MRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the whole brain on clinical scanners presents new opportunities for understanding brain development and disorders. The proposed technique enables such mapping by combining a three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol optimized for clinical feasibility. An index of orientation dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of neurites. We evaluate the method both in simulation and on a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. Results demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density and orientation dispersion estimates, thereby disentangling two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the analysis of each factor individually. We additionally show that while orientation dispersion can be estimated with just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at least two shells and can be estimated more accurately with the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative two-shell protocols. The optimized protocol takes about 30min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a typical clinical setting. We further show that sampling fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the acquisition time to just 10min with minimal impact on the accuracy of the estimates. This demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications, such as neonatal and dementia imaging.},

Methods Our framework uses the decomposition property of the Bloch equations to enable joint design of RF-pulses and shim array fields for restricted slice excitation and refocusing with auto-differentiation optimization. Bloch simulations are performed independently on orthogonal basis vectors, Mx, My, and Mz, which enables designs for arbitrary initial magnetizations. Requirements for refocusing pulse designs are derived from the extended phase graph formalism obviating time-consuming sub-voxel isochromatic simulations to model the effects of crusher gradients. To refine resultant slice-profiles because of voxelwise optimization functions, we propose an algorithm that stochastically offsets spatial points at which loss is computed during optimization. Results We first applied our proposed design framework to standard slice-selective excitation and refocusing pulses in the absence of non-linear {$\Delta$}B0 shim array fields and compared them against pulses designed with Shinnar-Le Roux algorithm. Next, we demonstrated our technique in a simulated setup of fetal brain imaging in pregnancy for restricted-slice excitation and refocusing of the fetal brain.

Methods The 3D-DISPENSE sequence contains a 3D stack-of-spiral navigator generated between the diffusion preparation and the turbo spin-echo image acquisition from the twin pathway of a stimulated echo. Unlike normal navigator methods, 3D-DISPENSE separates the navigator acquisition from the imaging readout without compromising the image SNR. Phase information from the navigators was included in an iterative image reconstruction algorithm to correct for intershot phase incoherence caused by motion. Results In a phantom experiment, 3D-DISPENSE correctly estimated deliberately introduced phase errors. In a moving phantom, motion-induced artifacts in the DWI were greatly mitigated by 3D-DISPENSE. The ADC after 3D-DISPENSE correction was identical to the reference. In a brain diffusion tensor experiment, phase-incoherence artifacts from breathing, cardiac, and subject motion were removed almost perfectly in all view angles, resulting in distortion-free DWI and color-coded fractional anisotropy maps with 1.5-mm isotropic resolution and nearly full brain coverage. Conclusion Three-dimensional DISPENSE corrects motion-induced phase-incoherence artifacts in 3D multishot diffusion imaging and produces high-quality 3D DWI and DTI.},

  abstract = {It has been observed that fast spin-echo (FSE) images with a large field of view ({$>$}40 cm) in certain directions exhibit unusual ghosting artifacts that cannot be eliminated with existing ghost removal methods. These artifacts have been related to a higher-order magnetic field perturbation (known as the concomitant field, or Maxwell field) concomitant to the linear i-maging gradient, in accordance with the Maxwell equations Several methods have been developed to eliminate or minimize the effects of the concomitant magnetic field by redesigning the FSE pulse sequences. In the slice-selection direction, the gradient waveforms are made symmetrical about the refocusing RF pulses wherever possible. Surrounding the first refocusing pulse, such symmetry cannot be achieved due to the slice-refocusing gradient, which is often combined with the left crusher. In this case, it is shown how crusher gradients can be reshaped to nullify the phase due to the concomitant field. In the phase-encoding direction, the gradient amplitude is reduced and its duration is prolonged. Artifacts due to the readout gradient are eliminated by reshaping the prephasing lobe, while keeping its area fixed. In all the three directions, the gradient waveforms are adjusted so that they have minimal overlap. Selected methods have been implemented on a clinical scanner, and typically reduce the ghost intensities in phantom and human images by a factor of 3.},

These microfibres were fabricated by the co-electrospinning of PCL-polysiloxane-based surfactant (PSi) mixture as shell and polyethylene oxide as core. The addition of PSi had a significant effect on the size of resultant electrospun fibres and the formation of hollow microfibres. The presence of PSi in both co-electrospun PCL microfibre surface and cross-section, revealed by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), enabled water to wet these fibres completely (i.e., zero contact angle) and remained active for up to 12 months after immersing in water. PCL and PCL-PSi fibres with uniaxial orientation were constructed into water-filled phantoms. MR measurement revealed that water molecules diffuse anisotropically in the PCL-PSi phantom. Co-electrospun hollow PCL-PSi microfibres have desirable hydrophilic properties for the construction of a new generation of tissue-mimicking dMRI phantoms.,                         Image 1                                 ,                                        {$\bullet$}               An inclusion of polysiloxane-based surfactant (PSi) into PCL solution improved the hydrophilicity of electrospun PCL fibres.                                         {$\bullet$}               Electrospun PCL-PSi fibres remained hydrophilic over a time period of up to 12 months.                                         {$\bullet$}               EDX analysis confirmed Si distribution on fibre surface and cross-section, which is responsible for the wettability of PCL-PSi fibres.                                         {$\bullet$}               Hollow PCL-PSi microfibres were only produced via co-electrospinning of a miscible combination of shell and core solutions.                                         {$\bullet$}               Phantoms were constructed from hollow PCL and PCL-PSi fibres, and water was detected by dMRI only from the latter.},

  abstract = {Image reconstruction is essential for imaging applications across the physical and life sciences, including optical and radar systems, magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray computed tomography, positron emission tomography, ultrasound imaging and radio astronomy. During image acquisition, the sensor encodes an intermediate representation of an object in the sensor domain, which is subsequently reconstructed into an image by an inversion of the encoding function. Image reconstruction is challenging because analytic knowledge of the exact inverse transform may not exist a priori, especially in the presence of sensor non-idealities and noise. Thus, the standard reconstruction approach involves approximating the inverse function with multiple ad hoc stages in a signal processing chain, the composition of which depends on the details of each acquisition strategy, and often requires expert parameter tuning to optimize reconstruction performance. Here we present a unified framework for image reconstruction-automated transform by manifold approximation (AUTOMAP)-which recasts image reconstruction as a data-driven supervised learning task that allows a mapping between the sensor and the image domain to emerge from an appropriate corpus of training data. We implement AUTOMAP with a deep neural network and exhibit its flexibility in learning reconstruction transforms for various magnetic resonance imaging acquisition strategies, using the same network architecture and hyperparameters. We further demonstrate that manifold learning during training results in sparse representations of domain transforms along low-dimensional data manifolds, and observe superior immunity to noise and a reduction in reconstruction artefacts compared with conventional handcrafted reconstruction methods. In addition to improving the reconstruction performance of existing acquisition methodologies, we anticipate that AUTOMAP and other learned reconstruction approaches will accelerate the development of new acquisition strategies across imaging modalities.},

In this paper, we explore the use of the Gini index (GI), of a discrete signal, as a more effective measure of its sparsity for a significantly improved performance in its reconstruction from compressive samples. We also successfully incorporate the GI into a stochastic optimization algorithm for signal reconstruction from compressive samples and illustrate our approach with both synthetic and real signals/images.},

  abstract = {Purpose To extend the KomaMRI simulator with motion capabilities that enable the simulation of both simple, parametrizable motion patterns and arbitrarily complex spin trajectories. Additionally, we introduce a novel file format for storing and sharing dynamic digital phantoms. Methods The existing Phantom structure in KomaMRI has been extended with a new motion field, which preserves support for static phantoms and introduces the capability to define dynamic models, composed of either a single or an arbitrary set of elementary motions. Each motion entry is composed of an action, a time curve, and a spin span, allowing for modular definition and full parameter independence across motion components. An HDF5-based phantom file format has been defined, along with two I/O functions within the simulator. Motion-related MRI experiments have been conducted for both illustrative and comparative evaluation. Results Illustrative experiments reveal motion-related effects commonly observed in real MRI, such as time of flight and phase contrast. Comparative evaluations show strong qualitative and quantitative agreement with results reported by other simulation tools and with at least a three-fold reduction in computation time. Conclusions The proposed extension adds flexible motion modeling and simulation capabilities to KomaMRI. The proposed new functions allow for accurate and high temporal and spatial resolution, only limited by computational cost.},

  abstract = {Purpose To propose a new method for characterizing sequences with higher resolution or readout length than allowed by standard field monitoring approaches. Methods Our proposed method was devised to characterize entire readout gradients by stitching multiple segment-specific dynamic field measurements obtained across a matched number of consecutive TRs corresponding to a certain segmentation of the readout gradient. The utility of our proposed stitching method for high-order dynamic field measurements was illustrated using 2D spiral sequences. It was first demonstrated at 10.5 T and then at 7 T using both simulated and experimental MRI data. At 10.5 T, two extreme spiral readout scenarios were considered where standard field monitoring did not work. Our method was then validated in humans at 7 T, where spiral sequences were employed for brain imaging. At 7 T, our method was further compared against gradient impulse response function (GIRF)-based trajectory prediction. Results At 10.5 T, our stitching method outperformed the standard approach, producing plausible dynamic field measurements throughout entire readouts. At 7 T, it produced nearly identical measurements for one readout where standard field monitoring also worked; for another readout when standard field monitoring did not work, it still produced sensible field measurements, improving image reconstruction for both simulated and experimental MRI data. Conclusion Our proposed stitching method provides an effective means to characterize challenging imaging gradients using commercially available hardware and without assuming a linear gradient system, thereby having utility for many applications especially those aiming for ultrahigh-resolution MRI at ultrahigh field.},
